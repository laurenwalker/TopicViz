This trend reflects the growing recognition of the importance of spatial processes in shaping ecological interactions. Several different approaches have been employed by ecologists for quantifying patterns in spatial data. One approach developed originally by geographers focuses on quantifying spatial autocorrelation and hypothesis testing. Geostatistics is another approach that was originally developed by geologists for quantifying and Interpolating spatial data. A third approach   point process   statistics was developed for analyzing patterns in the physical location of plants and animals. All of these methods have unique features that are desirable in ecological applications but the relationships and similarities among these methods have not been fully explored. The diversity of these various approaches is sometimes overwhelming to ecologists and may represent an impediment to the choice of effective statistical methods for the analysis of ecological data. We propose to assemble a working group of 10 12 scientists representing a spectrum of backgrounds including pure statistics and various ecological disciplines. The group will compare these differing approaches to spatial analysis and summarize their similarities and differences. Ultimately we intend to provide a road map for ecologists to use in the selection of statistical methods for analyzing spatial data. 	1999	2000106:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	25	1	0.25	0.142857143	0.035714286	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.071428571	0.035714286	0.071428571	0.178571429	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.093023256	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.186046512	0	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0	0	0.069767442	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0.046511628	0	0	0.023255814	0.023255814	0.069767442	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0.069767442	0	0.046511628	0	0.023255814	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.046511628	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0.11627907	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.046511628	0.023255814	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2172	" ;Lele, Subhash; Taper, Mark; Lewin-Koh, Nicholas; "	The Evidence Project: Supporting scientific claims	 Scientists strive to understand the operation of natural processes. To this end they collect data both experimental and observational. The objective and quantitative interpretation of data as evidence for one hypothesis over another hypothesis is an integral part of the scientific process. None of the existing schools of statistical inference fully addresses the needs of working scientists. Scientists are forced to twist their thinking to pigeon hole their analyses into existing paradigms. We believe that a revision of statistical theory is in order reflecting the needs of practicing ecologists. Through a dialog amongst working scientists statisticians and philosophers this working group will seek to construct a new statistical approach focused on the quantification of evidence which will supplement traditional paradigms. We will hone and demonstrate our approach through applications to difficult problems of ecological data analysis. 	1999	2002110:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	5	1	0.22972973	0.108108108	0.040540541	0.027027027	0	0.22972973	0.027027027	0.027027027	0.013513514	0.22972973	0.040540541	0	0.013513514	0	0	0.013513514	0.044444444	0.011111111	0.011111111	0	0.2	0	0.077777778	0	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0.011111111	0.033333333	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0.011111111	0	0.088888889	0.011111111	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0.111111111	0	0.088888889	0	0	0	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0.022222222	0.011111111	0.011111111	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0.022222222	0	0	0.044444444	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2178	" ;Jackson, Robert; "	Towards an explicit representation of root distributions in global models	 Mechanistic models that examine the feedbacks between vegetation and climate (including atmospheric CO2) are critical for predicting the consequences of global change. Currently the best and most explicit descriptions of root distributions in ecosystem biome and global models are simple two or three layer representations that separate shallow and deep water at arbitrary depth  Neilson 1995). We recently completed a literature review of root distributions for terrestrial biomes and various plant functional groups (Jackson . 1996; Canadell . 1996) with the goal of providing quantitative root distributions for global models. In this proposal we highlight results of that literature synthesis and outline ways that root distributions could be incorporated into existing models (including BIOME BGC CASA CENTURY Heimann MAPSS BIOME2 SIB2 and TEM). We propose to hold two short term workshops at the NCEAS to accomplish this goal. In the first workshop participants will meet in Santa Barbara to review models receive input from specific model developers and propose model exercises. After this workshop participants will modify model code as necessary test the adjusted models and then return to the NCEAS to run a joint modeling exercise. Our ultimate goal is to incorporate root distributions into the three or four models best suited to assessing global C H2O and nutrient fluxes including at least one GCM. NCEAS funds requested in this proposal are leveraged by a financial contribution from BAHC (Biological Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle) with interest in the global consequences of rooting depth for climate and hydrology models. 	1996	1999129:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	1	0.285714286	0.071428571	0.107142857	0	0.035714286	0	0.25	0	0	0.142857143	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0.06	0.02	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0	0.18	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0.2	0	0.14	0.08	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0.04	0.02	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2219	" ;Reiners, William; "	Modeling ecological influences across landscape space	 The general objective of this sabbatical proposal is to promote our understanding of how an event or condition on one part of a landscape can lead to ecological effects somewhere else on that landscape.

An appropriate metric should be interpretable in the context of the ecological theory that motivated the studies and be statistically tractable (although the latter is of secondary importance). Accomplishing these goals is a difficult task and at a minimum requires clarification of the meaning of   effect size   or   interaction strength   and elucidation of the links among ecological theory mathematical models experimental design and the extraction of appropriate metrics from experimental data.

The science has moved from point models and 1D models to 2D and in aquatic systems 3D theoretical and mechanistic representations of ecological processes. Landscape ecology is a focal area for much of this activity but here much of the focus is on abstract rather than explicit space and on theoretical rather than realistically parameterized models of processes in explicit space. Receiving less emphasis and of great promise for basic and applied purposes is a focus on the interactions of ecosystem elements across explicit landscape space. Exception to this generality are spatially explicit population models which combine population simulators with data for particular landscapes. The purpose of this proposal is to promote a focus on spatially explicit modeling involving a wide range of ecological phenomena beyond populations. This proposal outlines a conceptual framework for investigating and modeling the propagation of ecological influences across explicit landscape space. It proposes a joint project between NCEAS and NCGIA under the joint direction of the applicant (W.A. Reiners) F. Davis from NCEAS and Michael Goodchild from NCGIA. The proposal is designed to draw a diverse group of participants into the collective development of a conceptual framework and case studies which will ultimately foster research and modeling by a broad community of diverse scientists on the propagation of ecological influences across explicit landscape scale space. Specific project goals are to produce a conceptual paper on the subject together with a book either electronic or hard copy describing methods and providing illustrative models for conceptualizing modeling and simulating the transfer of cause and effect across landscapes.  	1997	1997174:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	25	1	0.45	0.1	0	0	0	0	0.05	0	0	0.05	0	0.15	0.05	0.05	0.1	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.206896552	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0.034482759	0.068965517	0.034482759	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2305	" ;Liebhold, Andrew; "	Application of geostatistics in ecology 	 Geostatistics is a field of statistics that focuses on measuring and modeling variation through space and or time. Geostatistical methods were originally developed for applications in the earth sciences. Recently there has been growing interest in the use of these methods for studying landscape level ecological problems. While many ecologists have recognized the potential uses of geostsatistics in ecology many of these applications have not occurred because there are no texts that are written in a way that ecologists can understand. Virtually all of the existing geoststatistics texts focus on geological problems. Thus the purpose of the proposed Resident Fellow is to spend 3 months writing a text that introduces and explains geostatistics and how it can be applied to ecological problems. The text will rely heavily upon the use of examples for illustrating statistical procedures.  	1997	1999188:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	24	1	0.227272727	0	0.045454545	0.045454545	0.045454545	0	0	0.045454545	0.136363636	0.045454545	0.136363636	0	0.090909091	0	0.136363636	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0.037735849	0.150943396	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.037735849	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.20754717	0.113207547	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0.056603774	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2700	" ;Peterson, Garry; Allen, Craig; Holling, Crawford; "	Cross scale organization and resilience of ecological systems	 Ecological organization varies across scales. We propose that the resilience of ecosystems depends upon the distribution of ecological functions performed by species and processes within and across scales. Furthermore we propose resilience and the vulnerability of species can be assessed by analyzing the distribution of function across scales by analyzing the distribution of species body masses that correlates strongly with the scale at which species perform ecological functions. Our working group will test these propositions using two complimentary approaches. Firstly we will develop and refine alternate methods of pattern detection and comparison to examine empirical ecosystem data. Secondly we will synthesize existing models of cross scale ecological organization. These approaches will be synthesized by using the analytical methods to compare body mass patterns produced by modeled and actual ecosystems. 	2000	2001230:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	1	0.307692308	0.028846154	0.009615385	0.009615385	0.038461538	0.096153846	0.269230769	0.096153846	0.028846154	0	0.019230769	0.009615385	0	0.028846154	0.009615385	0.048076923	0.008064516	0.024193548	0.016129032	0.064516129	0	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.161290323	0.032258065	0.008064516	0.016129032	0.008064516	0	0.008064516	0	0	0.008064516	0.129032258	0.024193548	0	0	0.008064516	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.024193548	0	0	0.008064516	0	0.120967742	0	0	0	0	0	0.008064516	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.040322581	0	0	0	0	0	0.008064516	0	0.024193548	0	0	0	0	0.008064516	0.137096774	0	0.008064516	0.008064516	0.016129032	0	0	0.016129032	0	0.008064516					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3780	" ;Sabo, John; "	Thermal physiology and the abundance and distribution of ectotherms	 Temperature and thermal physiology shape the behavior life history and population dynamics of ectotherms from insects to reptiles. Thus there has been considerable interest in deriving mathematical relationships between temperature and the performance and fitness of these animals. Bioenergetic models provide a method for estimating the daily available activity time of animals. Furthermore these energetics models can now be applied at large spatial scales using GIS to generate contour maps of the potential activity time available to a focal animal or assemblage of animals. Energetic based   activity time maps   offer ecologists and conservation biologists a practical tool for predicting habitat suitability for organisms across heterogeneous landscapes. However activity time is an index only of whether an animal can or cannot perform in a specific habitat and thus only a surrogate for habitat suitability. GIS based energetics models cannot presently predict animal abundance. Temperature driven models of animal abundance would be useful not only as a tool for testing ecological hypotheses at the landscape scale but also in identifying habitats that would support viable populations of species of special concern. As a postdoctoral fellow at NCEAS I will develop models that link energetics activity time and population dynamics. I will then apply these models to test ecological hypotheses at two spatial scales. First I will evaluate the role of landscape structure on lizard population dynamics at a local scale using data collected from a well studied field site in Northern California. Second I will use these models at a larger scale to develop a framework for predicting geographic variation in interaction strength among species in an assemblage of reptiles found in Western North America. 	2000	2001243:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	4	1	0.238095238	0	0.071428571	0.023809524	0.023809524	0	0.095238095	0.19047619	0.095238095	0.023809524	0.071428571	0.047619048	0.023809524	0.023809524	0.047619048	0.023809524	0	0	0	0.134615385	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0.057692308	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0.019230769	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0	0	0	0.057692308	0.038461538	0	0	0	0.057692308	0	0	0	0.019230769	0.038461538	0.134615385	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0.019230769	0.115384615	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0.038461538	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0.019230769	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4100	" ;Hobbs, N.; Illius, Andrew; Lundberg, Per; Owen-Smith, Norman; "	Dynamics of large mammalian herbivores in changing environments: Alternative modeling approaches	 The worlds populations of large herbivores have shown dramatically different dynamics during the last two decades. The abundance and distribution of some ungulate species has declined abruptly while other species have become excessively abundant and still others have shown complex oscillatory dynamics. These patterns seem to result from a composite of influences including those operating at global and local scales. Conventional population models are rooted in assumptions about steady state and do not adequately incorporate environmental variability.

This project has been highly productive in database design and we hope to take advantage of this success to push the resultant database system toward more rapid international acceptance and use by providing additional analytical and interface tools and demonstration datasets. We here request funds for two members of the Vegetation Classification Working Group Stephan Hennekens and Robert Peet to visit NCEAS as Center Fellows to work with John Harris and the other members of the NCEAS scientific computing staff. Hennekens and Peet would participate in the design construction and evaluation of database interface tools and associated analytical tools that will be required for wide acceptance of this information system. Hennekens is author of TurboVeg the current international standard plot database now in use in over 25 countries with over a million plots. He would work at NCEAS with Harris for two months to develop user interfaces for the database system. He shares the vision of the Working Group that a new database system is needed that retains the high level of functionality of TurboVeg but which is web accessible perfectly archived so as to be citable easily scalable and platform independent. In addition we request funds for Robert Peet to spend 5 months at NCEAS to directly work with John Harris to test and refine the database system and associated tools. These efforts should provide sufficient refinement to assure easy and effective use of the database system and thereby increase the probability of rapid adoption by the scientific community. 	2001	200226:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	42	1	0.261904762	0.071428571	0	0	0.047619048	0.142857143	0.142857143	0	0.047619048	0.047619048	0	0.142857143	0.071428571	0	0.023809524	0	0.017857143	0	0.071428571	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.071428571	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.25	0	0.053571429	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.107142857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0.071428571	0.035714286	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2041	" ;Damuth, John; "	Climatic and Habitat Inference from Features of Mammalian Paleocommunities	 Paleomammalogists have explored in recent years a variety of techniques for inferring past climate and vegetation from structural characteristics of fossil mammal communities and faunas.

The goals of the EMDI are to compare model estimates of terrestrial carbon fluxes to estimates from ground based measurements. Proposed tasks include finalizing synthesis for ancillary data sets agreement on data formats and establishment of computer server s (one proposed to be located at NCEAS). The proposed Working Group will utilize synthesized data from the Global Primary Productivity Data Initiative (GPPDI) NPP Working Groups 1 2 and 3 (WG1 WG3) held under support from NCEAS and the International Geosphere Biosphere Program Data and Information System (IGBP DIS). Methods for synthesizing and extrapolating sparse field observations of above ground and below ground NPP were developed during WG1 WG3 to create consistent estimates of total (above below ground) NPP for points and regional scale cells. The results of this work are being presented in a total of 13 peer reviewed papers to be submitted to international journals in 3   waves   (30 Nov 98; 15 Jan 99; 31 Mar 99). The papers incorporate tables of NPP estimates which will also be available as downloadable data sets initially through the NCEAS server and later (subject to final approval) through the NASA funded ORNL DAAC at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.In October 1998 a planning meeting was held in conjunction with the NCEAS WG3 to discuss opportunities to dovetail NPP data sets from the GPPDI with a global model data intercomparison. It was agreed that the primary question to be addressed by this activity will be to test simulated controls on the carbon budget with the GPPDI data providing model constraints for autotrophic carbon fluxes. The NPP data sets emerging from the GPPDI are derived from both plot and spatially explicit sampling designs thus enabling a valid comparison between point and area based models and data. It was proposed that the model data comparison would need two major working groups to facilitate the comparisons. The first would be a data intensive workshop where primary (NPP) and ancillary (climate soils etc.) data sets would be synthesized formatted and made available to participating modeling groups. The second working group would entail visualization and analyses of model results. The purpose of this proposal is to solicit support from NCEAS to host the first Working Group of the data intensive workshop. 	1999	2001281:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	1	0.467889908	0.04587156	0.027522936	0.018348624	0	0.04587156	0.027522936	0	0.018348624	0.201834862	0.018348624	0.036697248	0.036697248	0.055045872	0	0	0	0.006329114	0.006329114	0.006329114	0.183544304	0	0.056962025	0	0	0	0.012658228	0.006329114	0	0	0	0	0	0.278481013	0	0	0	0.069620253	0.006329114	0	0.025316456	0	0	0	0.018987342	0	0	0.006329114	0	0	0	0.006329114	0	0	0	0.025316456	0.018987342	0.006329114	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044303797	0	0.006329114	0.03164557	0	0	0	0	0.018987342	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.006329114	0	0.006329114	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0.006329114	0	0.006329114	0.082278481	0	0	0	0.018987342	0.012658228	0.006329114					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		5300	" ;Hibbard, Kathy; "	Intercomparison of global scale ecological models and field data: EMDI III	 The Ecosystem Model Data Intercomparison (EMDI) program of the Task Force on Global Analysis Interpretation and Modelling (GAIM) is facilitating interactions between international modeling and data synthesis teams beyond what any individual team can reasonably propose or fund. The third EMDI Workshop will be held at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) April 21 24 2002 funding support from NSF and from NCEAS. The Workshop will focus on the development of a new understanding of the nature and geographic variations in the carbon cycle based on two earlier Workshops in which model inter comparisons and model data comparisons have been carried out. These issues are central to GAIM and have important synergies with the agendas of several other IGBP Core Projects such as GCTE and BAHC the Carbon Joint Project Activities and also international programs such as FLUXNET. The Workshop will focus on spatial analyses of regional and global ecosystem model results with observed annual Net Primary Productivity (NPP) seasonal NPP and time series of carbon fluxes from FluxNet flux tower observations. Further analyses of model results and the (IGBP DIS GAIM) Global Primary Production Data Initiative (GPPDI) data sets will be made. FLUXNET data which includes meteorology for evaluating spatially derived climate carbon pools and component fluxes at a subset of sites will be added which will allow for rigorous tests of certain types and components of models. The comparisons of model outputs with field measurements will help to establish the level of confidence that we have in the processes and mechanisms that underlie the modeled carbon cycle dynamics. The Workshop will also increase the ongoing collaboration between scientists developing models and those conducting field measurements. In the first two Workshops participation of approximately 20 models has been established model model inter comparisons have been made using new methods developed by the Workshops and initial comparisons of the model results with GPPDI data have been made. In the third Workshop we will (1) update the model outputs with new runs using any advances made by the modelers (2) include additional observational data sets  FLUXNET) in the model data inter comparisons and report the findings in multi authored paper(s) and (3) break new ground by initiating a synthesis of model results to make an agreed single best estimate of global primary production at 0.5 degree resolution. 	2002	2002306:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	21	1	0.403508772	0	0.070175439	0	0	0.087719298	0	0.140350877	0	0.01754386	0.157894737	0	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0.087719298	0	0	0	0.066666667	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0.055555556	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0.177777778	0.022222222	0	0	0.011111111	0.011111111	0	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044444444	0.055555556	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044444444	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0.111111111	0	0.055555556	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6660	" ;Moe, Jannicke; "	Stoichiometry and population dynamics of consumer resource systems: A combined experimental and modelling approach	 A recent approach in ecology ecological stoichiometry recognises resource quality (nutrient ratios) as a limiting factor in addition to resource quantity. In the proposed project we will apply this approach to study classical population ecological problems in a new perspective. Theoretical models of consumer resource systems have predicted dramatic and counter intuitive changes in population dynamics when nutrient recycling and nutrient limited growth are considered. However most of these models are not yet evaluated experimentally. An important prediction is that increased phosphorous enrichment leads to more unstable population dynamics of the consumer and eventually to extinction although the resource persists. We will test this prediction by exposing laboratory systems of zooplankton (Daphnia) and algae to a range of phosphorous concentrations and study the long term dynamics of the system. Using non parametric modelling we aim at developing a new statistically derived model for this system. Such models make few a priori assumptions about the form of the functions and are therefore well suited for exploring unknown relationships among variables. By combining such a flexible modelling approach with the stoichiometric perspective we expect to provide new insight into general ecological problems. 	2003	2004334:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	61	1	0.131578947	0.052631579	0.105263158	0.026315789	0.131578947	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.078947368	0.052631579	0	0.026315789	0.078947368	0.105263158	0	0.026315789	0.131578947	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0.02	0.02	0.1	0	0	0	0	0.06	0	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0.02	0.16	0.02	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.06	0	0	0	0.22	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.04	0.02	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7760	" ;Hochberg, Michael; "	Analyzing pattern and process in human cultural diversity	 A major challenge for ecology is to understand the role of humans in the future of life on Earth.

We use the term ML loosely to distinguish between parametric statistics and a variety of new computational methods for recognizing and analyzing patterns in data. Generally parametric methods assume highly restrictive theoretical properties of data such as additivity linearity independence and distribution  normality). Ecological data by contrast represent highly complex systems and commonly violate these assumptions 1 3 . Unfortunately failure to appreciate these subtleties of ecological data often results in misguided analysis and incomplete or incorrect conclusions. In recent years ML researchers have developed techniques for analyzing data not suited to parametric statistics. Older machine learning algorithms include neural networks and decision trees. Now newer techniques like boosting and kernel methods  support vector machines) provide new opportunities for extracting subtle patterns from complex data while hybrid methods integrate parametric models and ML to exploit computation and hard won biological understanding simultaneously. Despite successes elsewhere  bioinformatics astrophysics) ML has not been widely adopted by ecologists. Complex situations that might be addressed with ML include identifying optimal policies for managing ecological systems under uncertainty forecasting nonlinear modeling and scientific inference with non independent data. Accommodating these scientific and statistical difficulties within parametric statistics ranges from cumbersome to impossible.

The end result of this working group will be a thorough review of the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches under different circumstances and a set of easy to use statistical tools for use by non specialists. 	2007	2010446:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	1	0.333333333	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		11981	" ;Gruner, Daniel; Shurin, Jonathan; Hillebrand, Helmut; "	Comparing trophic structure across ecosystems 		2007	2008456:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	1	0.254545455	0.018181818	0	0.036363636	0.090909091	0.236363636	0.054545455	0.072727273	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0.036363636	0.054545455	0.054545455	0.054545455	0	0	0	0	0.015151515	0.015151515	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.075757576	0	0	0	0.242424242	0.045454545	0	0.106060606	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0.045454545	0.015151515	0.015151515	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015151515	0.015151515	0.03030303	0	0.015151515	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0.015151515	0.015151515	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0.045454545	0.060606061	0.015151515	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12054	" ;Holt, Robert; Tewksbury, Joshua; Buckley, Lauren; Angilletta, Michael; "	 Mechanistic distribution models: Energetics fitness and population dynamics 	 Biologists must understand the dynamics of species distributions to address questions about community structure and to predict distributional shifts over space and time.

Several distinct but complementary mechanistic models of species distributions were recently published and share strong mechanistic and physiological bases. The working group will evaluate these mechanistic models synthesize salient features of each and generalize the synthetic model to include physiological adaptation (both plastic and evolutionary) species interactions and dispersal limitations.

However factors other than the intrinsic quality of a manuscript can affect its publication and dissemination. Publication bias can be perceived as the extent to which the relative perceived merit of work predicts the relative actual merit of the work and such biases can affect both the publications available to the community funding allocation and potentially the career trajectories of researchers. General biases previously detected include the file drawer problem over interpretation of data dissemination bias institutional or individual status bias and gender bias. However the degree or prevalence of these factors has not been extensively explored within the discipline of ecology. Using survey data from multiple sources online databases and bibliometric methods I aim to evaluate the utility of current metrics explore the incidence of biases associated with publication and dissemination of material and determine the potential impact of publication bias with respect to the composition of the working and publishing ecological community. I also intend to develop and advocate for best practices to be used by journals editors reviewers and authors. For example preliminary research has demonstrated that the process of double blind review may serve to reduce non conscious bias against female authors. This review method is not widely practiced in ecology and I am currently examining community response to double blind review and evaluating both the benefits and challenges associated with implementing double blind review practices. 	2007	2010487:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	5	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12128	" ;Kelling, Steve; Jones, Matthew; Madin, Joshua; Bowers, Shawn; Schildhauer, Mark; Sugarbaker, Larry; "	Towards a unified model for describing ecological and environmental observation data		2007	2009505:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	1	0.307692308	0.128205128	0.051282051	0.025641026	0	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.102564103	0	0.025641026	0.102564103	0.128205128	0	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.429752066	0	0.008264463	0	0.008264463	0	0	0.041322314	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.074380165	0	0.016528926	0.024793388	0	0	0	0.090909091	0	0	0.024793388	0	0	0	0.05785124	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024793388	0.016528926	0	0.016528926	0	0.008264463	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008264463	0	0	0	0	0.008264463	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008264463	0	0	0	0	0.008264463	0	0	0	0.05785124	0	0	0.016528926	0	0	0.033057851	0	0	0	0	0	0.008264463	0	0	0.008264463					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12193	" ;Reichman, O.; Schildhauer, Mark; Jones, Matthew; "	Data management and analysis tools supporting adaptive management in South African parks	 Kruger National Park is faced with a challenge common to many research stations where dozens of loosely coordinated monitoring and experimental projects are underway at any time. The main challenge is how to effectively collect present and preserve this highly variable collection of scientific data for collaborative and integrative analyses. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has supported a partnership between Kruger National Park and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) over the past two years to address this informatics challenge by implementing and refining an approach for archiving KNPs scientific field data using methods developed and tested by NCEAS the Long Term Ecological Research program and other partners. The successful deployment of a metadata archive (Metacat) at KNP along with two successful training workshops in its use have validated the power and viability of this approach. Kruger National Park is now part of a global   Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity   (KNB) which is based on the use of metadata standards in ecology particularly Ecological Metadata Language or   EML   documents that are stored in Metacat database servers. The EML metadata specification is also being used by NCEAS LTER the Organization of Biological Field Stations and the Ecological Society of America all of which are examples of other major ecological research institutions that are committed to using a common metadata standard for documenting their data. At Kruger staff and scientists have been trained to use the Morpho metadata and data management application to document their data holdings and upload these to the Kruger data repository (Metacat). This project will: A) expand this data system to the broader collection of parks and research stations in South Africa and B) create the additional analysis infrastructure needed to effectively use these data in adaptive management approaches in the parks. 	2007	2008515:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	1	0.125	0.125	0.125	0.0625	0.125	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0.125	0	0	0.125	0.125	0.636363636	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0	0.054545455	0	0	0.054545455	0	0	0	0.018181818	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12206	" ;Schildhauer, Mark; Jones, Matthew; "	 SDCI NMI improvements: Development of Kepler CORE a comprehensive open robust and extensive scientific workflow infrastructure 	 The UC Santa Barbara work on this project will include participation in project meetings interaction with the broader scientific community about requirements for Kepler and contributions to the development of the Kepler Core software.

However ecosystem models themselves are far from perfect and need continued improvement. We will advance this necessary model improvement using some of the longest and most comprehensive data sets on CO2 impacts on ecosystems from field experiments. Twelve ecosystem process and land surface models which are being used for predicting terrestrial response to atmospheric and climatic change will be parameterized with site and weather data from the Duke University and Oak Ridge National Laboratory free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments. We will evaluate the ability of the models to reproduce the measured processes of the carbon water and nitrogen cycles of the experimental forest stands and their responses to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration. Similarities and differences among the models and their components will provide guidance for improving all of the models. With the experimental data as a benchmark for model performance the utility of the models for extrapolation to environmental change questions can be demonstrated with increased confidence. This working group will include participants who are most familiar with the experimental data a data manager to assemble and format the data for model input representatives from diverse modeling groups and a neutral observer to synthesize model results.

Using global data to test implicit versus explicit representation of microbial activity in litter decomposition models	 Despite the major contribution of decomposition to global carbon and nitrogen cycles it remains poorly understood. This uncertainty is reflected in the diversity of approaches used to depict decomposition in ecosystem models and in debate regarding if or how microbes should be explicitly represented. I propose to compile a large scale long term database of litter decomposition data which I will use to compare two sets of decomposition models: the first varies only in how microbial activity is modeled; the second compares the best model(s) from the first set to a range of published models. Conducting a sophisticated model comparison using spatially and temporally extensive data will allow me to evaluate the relevance of explicitly incorporating microbial activity into large scale decomposition models and compare the ability of published models to accurately describe global decomposition. 	2009	2011543:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	4	1	0.353846154	0.046153846	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.046153846	0.015384615	0.030769231	0.138461538	0.015384615	0.030769231	0.061538462	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.123076923	0.061538462	0.03125	0	0	0.135416667	0.083333333	0.010416667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0.010416667	0.010416667	0.010416667	0.09375	0	0.020833333	0	0	0.010416667	0	0.010416667	0.010416667	0	0	0	0.020833333	0.041666667	0	0.010416667	0.010416667	0	0.083333333	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0.020833333	0	0.010416667	0	0	0	0.010416667	0.010416667	0.03125	0	0	0.010416667	0	0	0	0.010416667	0	0.041666667	0.010416667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010416667	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12320	" ;Crone, Elizabeth; Menges, Eric; Ellis, Martha; "	When are matrix models useful for management? An empirical test across plant populations 	 In the past three decades the role of matrix based demographic models in plant conservation has steadily increased. However the reliability of these methods remains hotly debated. Most tests of model performance have relied on strict conditions for either the datasets being tested or the criteria used to judge accuracy of the results. This leads to a potential disconnect between the variety of ways in which models are used in practice and the limited set of conditions where their performance has been evaluated. Our working group brings together a group of ecologists who have worked with these models in applied settings. We will review how models have actually been used in the recent past and discuss what predictions we expect these models to usefully provide. We will then use our demographic data from long term studies to evaluate how well demographic models actually predict the dynamics of perennial plant populations.

Despite the fact that a great deal of work in physiology has been done on this problem and that literally thousands of niche models (regressions of distribution on environment) have been run we know surprisingly little about basic questions. Which aspects of environment are most central in controlling the distribution and abundance of organisms? How does this change with organism? with scale? what are the mechanisms linking environment to species distributions? We propose to assemble a state of the art set of environmental layers that incorporate well known but rarely used measures that have direct links to physiological processes like frost water stress growing season soil properties drainage properties etc. We will assemble these variables into a unified global gridded high resolution data set that will be made available to the public. This will be of enormous benefit to the community.

These statistical models are often used to test hypotheses and make inferences about ecological theories and management decisions based on available data. This explosion in the application of such models is due to rapid and current development of methodology to carryout statistical inference of complex nonlinear models and improvements in computer power (faster and multiple processors). While there are many tools available for statistical inference that differ in their effectiveness for specific applications no formal comparisons have been conducted between various software packages. It is therefore important to identify which tools are most appropriate for given applications and to demonstrate how such tools can be used most effectively. We evaluate three open source software packages commonly used to carry out statistical inference of complex nonlinear models: OpenBUGS AD Model Builder and R. To test the strengths and weaknesses of each package we will bring together experts in all three software packages and apply a common set of ecological models. Working directly with NCEAS informatics staff we will produce a web based guide regarding the utility of each package for particular applications that includes annotated model code for each package the data sets used in the applications and peer reviewed articles. We will also identify how the different packages can be modified to improve their applicability to an array of complex nonlinear models that are essential for advancing ecological research. As statistical models are becoming increasingly more complex and ecologists are faced with a myriad of software options the results of this project will provide support for ecologists and analysts across a broad spectrum of specialties. 	2011	2011642:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	1	0.148148148	0.148148148	0.111111111	0	0.074074074	0.111111111	0	0.074074074	0.074074074	0.074074074	0.037037037	0.037037037	0.074074074	0	0.037037037	0	0.0625	0	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.21875	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0.03125	0.15625	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0.09375	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12647	" ;Hackett, Edward; Parker, John; "	Advancing theory and research on scientific synthesis	 We propose a working group to advance theoretically grounded empirical study of scientific collaborations designed to achieve synthesis.

It generates emergent explanations beyond the scope of any one discipline dataset or method. It counterbalances scientific specialization capitalizes on existing data and can be used to address complex problems.

What we hope to produce need not serve as an wholesale replacement for current journals but as an alternative to promote faster reviews more transparency collaboration and more open access to the science we produce in every form. We are using the physics model of arXiv the open access policy common in evidence based medicine and the data sharing policies of most genetics research as a point of departure for our working group and our vision of the future of science publishing. We will bring together participants from every aspect of the publication process in ecology and evolution from scientists to publishers such as members of PLoS and arXiv to the gatekeepers of academic databases such as Google and ISI. To achieve our overarching goal we will address the following three objectives. (1) To discuss how to more effectively promote open science in ecology and evolution in general. The primary targets will be how to facilitate the linking of articles to their associated analytical and data attributes. Another target will be how to incorporate more of the discussion and review process associated with the end product including the decisions made in handling data and in analyzing and interpreting it in light of feedback from reviews. The deliverable will be a broad future directions paper on open science (including open access implications). (2) To discuss the viability of providing an arXiv pre publication open forum for ecology and evolution and how to incorporate peer review into such a system (which arXiv currently does not). We will discuss whether the current journal and publication models in ecology and evolution are outdated or able to adapt. The primary deliverable from this objective will be a synthesis paper of the limitations and strengths of the current publication models (from publisher handling of journals to treatment of reviews) and a discussion of future directions. (3) The final objective will be to launch a version of the platform proposed. The critical elements will be discussed at the final meeting by a reduced roster of the participants. The targets of this objective will be to define key elements needed for ecology and evolution specifically in an online model identify keystone elements needed for a beta version and develop a pipeline for launch and effective buy in by the community. Queens University has the capacity and staff to assist with providing the beta version for two years including Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Licensing part time staff DOIs and will include the journal as part of the Open Journals System. In summary this working group will provide an open science synthesis publication a balanced report on the state of the art for publishing in ecology and evolution and a beta version of an alternative model as an open journal. 	2012	2013658:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	78	1	0.308510638	0.095744681	0.063829787	0.063829787	0	0.095744681	0.031914894	0.074468085	0.010638298	0.021276596	0	0.085106383	0.021276596	0.095744681	0.021276596	0.010638298	0.181818182	0.006060606	0	0.006060606	0.018181818	0	0	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0	0.006060606	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0.012121212	0	0	0.084848485	0	0.006060606	0	0.012121212	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.006060606	0	0.042424242	0	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0	0.090909091	0	0.012121212	0	0.006060606	0.006060606	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.006060606	0.006060606	0.03030303	0	0.006060606	0	0	0.012121212	0	0.012121212	0.006060606	0	0.006060606	0.006060606	0	0.006060606	0	0.193939394	0	0.012121212	0	0	0	0.012121212	0.018181818	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12663	" ;Bridge, Eli; Rakhimberdiev, Eldar; Seavy, Nathaniel; Winkler, David; "	Establishing an open source animal tracking analysis platform for archival geolocators	 Light level geolocation data loggers (henceforth geologgers) are simple animal tracking devices that record light levels over short time intervals and allow for the inference of location based on the timing of sunrise and sunset. Although these devices have long been used to track marine vertebrates they have only recently achieved a level of miniaturization sufficient for use on small ( 50g) land birds. For centuries we have lacked the capability to determine how small birds move between breeding and wintering sites and the few recent studies that have used geologgers to reveal songbird migration paths mark a revolution in the fields of ornithology and terrestrial ecology. However a missing link in fulfilling the promise of this tracking method is a data analysis package that can make the most of the limited information stored on a geologger. Although a number of solutions exist they all fall short as being either very simplistic  there is no accounting for potential location error) or so sophisticated that very few potential users can execute an analysis. Because of these shortcomings there is a general lack of transparency and standardization with regard to the analysis and presentation of location data from geologger studies. Here we propose a working group that will bring together both simple and complicated analyses techniques into an extensive package for the R computing platform. In addition we will generate a user friendly graphical user interface (GUI) available via Movebank.org that can execute analyses for users with little or no familiarity with R. This analysis platform would allow users to load raw data run filters to identify possible analysis problems choose among analysis methods quickly run   canned   analyses and pursue more specialized analyses to test hypotheses regarding the timing direction and speed of migratory movements. In pursuit of this goal we propose to hold two meetings. The first will convene five biologists and statisticians working in the fields of marine biology and ornithology who have pioneered new methods for obtaining animal tracking data using geologgers. This core group will work to refine and synthesize the analysis techniques that they and others have created. The second meeting will bring together a group of 15 scientists including the core programming group as well as field biologists with geologger data sets that can be used to test the analysis platform. This second meeting will generate numerous examples of how to use the platform and will catalyze the implementation of the GUI. 	2012	2013666:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	1	0.25	0.083333333	0.083333333	0	0.083333333	0.083333333	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0.083333333	0	0.083333333	0	0.083333333	0.603603604	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.153153153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0.045045045	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.117117117	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12671	" ;Schildhauer, Mark; Jones, Matthew; "	Conceptualizing an Institute for Sustainable Earth and Environmental Software	 Investigators envision an Institute for Sustainable Earth and Environmental Software (ISEES) that coordinates development and sustainable support of innovative and interoperable scientific software tools that can transform science at the intersection of earth environmental and life sciences.

A better understanding of this morpholocial plasticity is crucial for biodiversity and bio monitoring studies. We believe that research in marine ecology will benefit enormously from new methods being produced by current research in computational science. For this workshop to our knowledge the first on this topic ever organized we propose to bring together about 20 scientists from a wide range of disciplines including developmental biology paleontology ecology computer science physics and mathematics who have research interests in modelling the development of algal and metazoan forms.

Land management will be a pivotal conservation issue in the coming decades as we begin to face the mounting problems of how to manage land that has recently been set aside in parks and reserves. Whereas much ecological theory has been applied to reserve design and reserve siting (island biogeography Williams 1984; viability models Armbruster and Lande 1993; metapopulation models McCollough 1996) virtually no theory has been applied to reserve management. I propose to seek generalizations from two standpoints: by looking for general lessons that emerge from a synthetic analysis of current land management activities and by searching for ways simple decision theory can help reserve managers choose among potential management strategies. The first focus will include an assessment and synthesis of current land management techniques  burning flooding weeding and restoring) and a meta analysis of the success of well documented management actions. For the second approach I will examine general theories and ask whether they are pertinent or whether specific models can ever be pertinent. It is important to emphasize that issues in reserve management may be so particular to local natural history that they offer little guidance. I do not intend to go into this project with the objective of finding a universal theory but rather with the objective of looking for avenues where theory will provide helpful perspectives. The practical outcome of this part of the investigation will be using a decision theory framework to build a simple interactive simulation model to look at the relative benefits of one management strategy over another. Finally I will propose two workshops one to bring together land managers with a few academics to discuss first hand experience with what techniques succeed and to identify decision making tools that would be useful from a land managers perspective and another workshop with about half land managers and half academics to brainstorm ways that theory might be developed to help in addressing on the ground management problems. NCEAS is a logical place to carry out this research because there will be a large number of researchers with whom I can interact sabbatical fellows workshops and postdocs. In addition the computer facilities and the NCEAS staff are well situated to make the research possible especially in building a database to answer synthetic questions and in the design of useful decision making models for land managers.  	1999	2002107:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	2	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2174	" ;Semmens, Brice; "	California Marine Managed Areas Survey		1998	1999108:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	2	0	0.485714286	0.114285714	0.085714286	0.057142857	0.028571429	0.085714286	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0.085714286	0	0	0.028571429	0	0.1	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.18	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.08	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0.06	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.1	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0.08	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2175	" ;Davis, Frank; Barrows, Cam; "	Ecological monitoring of multi species habitat conservation plans	 Adaptive management of conservation lands depends on reliable and timely information concerning the effects of management actions on targeted species and ecosystem processes.

The purpose of the Act is to protect and restore populations of threatened and endangered plants and animals and ecosystems and habitats on which they depend. The US Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) are responsible for the administration of the Act and for developing and implementing recovery efforts for listed species. Typically a recovery plan is written that outlines a number of actions that when completed are expected to enable the species to be delisted. About 500 final recovery plans have been written of which 420 cover single species. In recent years increasing effort has been directed toward producing multi species recovery plans. In total 926 species are covered by existing plans. The SCB and NCEAS with the full cooperation of the Fish and Wildlife Service has undertaken to review and characterize existing recovery plans. The project began in September 1998 with preparation of a draft detailed questionnaire that will be used as the primary tool for characterizing the plans. In mid December FWS biologists members of the regulated community representatives of environmental NGOs and people who will lead the seminars at which recovery plans will be evaluated participated in a workshop in Washington DC. Participants fine tuned an extremely detailed questionnaire and established the procedures to govern the comprehensive review process that will take place this winter. The goal of the review which will be carried out by 19 graduate student seminars at 18 different universities is: To compile a database and conduct exploratory analysis of the information in recovery plans in a manner that: facilitates communication among students faculty and the FWS; contributes toward developing training programs and guidance to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of producing recovery plans based on sound science. Each seminar will review about 10 recovery plans selected in a stratified random manner so that the roles and consequences of the following five factors can be assessed: (1) date the plan was prepared (2) type of plan (single vs. multiple species) (3) how when and why recovery plans are revised (4) evolutionary lineage; taxon of the focal species; and (5) life history of the species in particular whether it is narrow endemic versus wide ranging. To complete the detailed questionnaire students will need to answer hundreds of questions about each recovery plan. The sources of information they will use are the listing document the recovery plan FWS biannual reports to Congress and the resource person who the FWS will provide for each seminar group to help answer questions about its focal recovery plans. To keep seminars interactive and in touch with one another a webpage and website is being set up. One person from each seminar will be designated to interact with the webczar but all participants will be able to read what is happening and students will be able to communicate easily with one another via an e mail discussion list. Each seminar class will start by reviewing one recovery plan previously scored by experts from the FWS. This initial exercise is intended to help standardize procedures and to assess the significance of potential individual and regional differences in ways of answering the questionnaire. When the review team completes its analysis of a recovery plan the team leader will enter the data onto the website which translates into 200 plans nationally used in the analysis. These data will serve as the basis for a broad characterization and analysis of Recovery Plans that will be done at NCEAS in Santa Barbara April 10 13 1999. A draft paper based on the results of the analyses will serve as the basis for a workshop attended by people from the academic community and FWS to be held at NCEAS on May 13 16. The goal of the workshop is to produce a manuscript for publication in Conservation Biology that will synthesize the suggestions and recommendations for ways to improve recovery planning for species listed under the Endangered Species Act. Both activities at NCEAS will be led by Dee Boersma and Peter Kareiva.

All of these activities require that ecological units be defined and that their distribution on the landscape be known and understood. Vegetation classification contributes significantly to analysis of ecological problems that vary in scale from persisitence of tiny populations of endangered species to global projections of the impact of climate change. Technological advances have made practical large scale analyses that cross agency jurisdictions or geographic regions and address applied ecological issues as diverse as global change ecosystem management and conservation planning. However all such efforts depend on having available a common set of well defined and broadly accepted classification units. Through the combined efforts of The Nature Conservancy (TNC) the Ecological Society of America Vegetation Panel (ESA VP) and the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) the United States is on the verge of having its first fully functional widely applied vegetation classification system. The federal government has declared the need for a single standard and on October 22 1997 the Secretary of Interior acting as Chair of the Federal Geographic Data Committee approved the Vegetation Information and Classification Standard (http: biology.usgs.gov fgdc.veg) which is now the standard vegetation classification for U.S. Federal agencies and their cooperators. Yet there are still major obstacles ot overcome to make such a system operational and broadly accepted. ESA VP is working in close collaboration with TNC and FGDC to draft standards for field data acquisition type definition and peer review of proposed additions and changes. A fourth component an information infrastructure to manage the anticipated 107 plots and 104 plant associations required for a national system and to distribute this information across the web in a continually revised but perfectly archived format represents a major intellectual and practical obstacle to the realization of the system. It is this final piece that our proposal addresses. We propose to convene at NCEAS a working group to design construct and test prototypes of two core components of the information infrastructure necessary to support the U.S. National Vegetation Classification (US NVC): a stand alone vegetation plots database system with internet access tools and an addition to the TNC Heritage Data Management System that will allow the national classification database to be both continually revised and perfectly archived. Subsets of this working group would meet at intervals over a 2 yr period to develop and test components of the system. A postdoctoral associate employed by NCEAS would work in consultation with project coordinators TNC and federal government analysts and NCEAS staff to complete most of the actual design and programming. The prototypes would be demonstrated using a variety of data from the greater Yosemite vegetation mapping project.

This program has been initiated by DIVERSITAS a program for the study of the science of biodiversity. There are many different activities planned for IBOY that involve new science new integration as well as activities designed to publicize the value of biodiversity to the general public.In designing IBOY it has become evident that there are a large number of international biodiversity monitoring efforts. IBOY could bring focused attention to the monitoring agenda but we need to identify what particular aspects should be highlighted for maximum effect. A workshop is proposed with the primary objective of identifying biodiversity monitoring program opportunities that would be the most appropriate contribution to IBOY.A byproduct of this planning effort is to examine the various international monitoring programs and to evaluate if overall important aspects are being ignored as well as where there might be duplication of effort. Some of the issues we would address are: 1) What are some of the overriding questions related to monitoring? 2) How do answering these question relate to differing spatial and temporal scales (this is in essence the heart of the problem since there are so many scales of interest to different groups)? 3) What is the value (and downsides) of standardized methods for intersite comparisons in relation to the questions posed in 1 and 2? 4) How can we link data sets and approaches (a lot of thought has gone into this already for certain types of measurements)? 5) How can we move forward in biodiversity monitoring considering the multiplicity of efforts the lack of resources and often lack of political will?Such an analysis could help strengthen biodiversity research in general.  	1999	1999137:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	66	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2229	" ;Reichman, O.; "	KDI: Proposal development		1999	1999144:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	10	2	0.054054054	0.243243243	0	0.027027027	0.216216216	0.027027027	0	0.162162162	0.081081081	0.054054054	0.108108108	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0.081632653	0	0	0	0	0	0.12244898	0.020408163	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0.081632653	0	0.081632653	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0.020408163	0.020408163	0	0.040816327	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0.102040816	0	0	0.06122449	0	0	0	0	0.040816327	0	0	0	0	0	0.06122449	0	0	0	0.040816327	0	0.040816327	0	0.081632653	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2244	" ;Ives, Anthony;Frost, Thomas; "	Intrinsic and extrinsic variability in community dynamics	 The relative importance of intrinsic and extrinsic sources of variability in population dynamics has long been a question central to ecology. It has recently generated a wave of studies that use time series analyses to identify density dependence in single species data. One limitation of these efforts has been that with their emphasis on single species they do not explicitly include the effects of interactions among species. We propose to assemble a working group to examine intrinsic and extrinsic variability from a community perspective. We would assess the importance of species interactions as sources of intrinsic variability in population dynamics and explore how time series data on the population densities of all species in a community can be used to understand the role of species interactions.  	1996	1998146:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	2	0.176470588	0.333333333	0.117647059	0.019607843	0	0.058823529	0.058823529	0	0.019607843	0.058823529	0.058823529	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0.019607843	0.039215686	0.104477612	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0.044776119	0	0	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0.134328358	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.029850746	0.104477612	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.074626866	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2254	" ;Gilpin, Michael; Stine, Peter; "	Investigating alternative land use habitat conservation strategies using GIS and optimization modeling	 Our proposal intends to explore a future phase of the Alameda Contra Costa Biodiversity project by development of a tool for considering all land uses and assigning values that can be used in solving for an   optimum   allocation of the limited land resources of the study area.

Different methods produce very different results yet there is no rationale or benchmark for judging their adequacy or appropriateness. Existing systems also are incomplete because they lack rules that allow decisions to be made when the data are uncertain. No systematic testing of any such system has been undertaken. In this project we will synthesize and evaluate existing protocols for classifying species conservation status applied in the United States Australia and internationally. We will measure their performance in three ways: first by comparing the classifications resulting from individual protocols with assessments of extinction risk from detailed population and metapopulation studies for specific species; second by comparing classifications with simulations of hypothetical species for which true underlying dynamic processes are known; and third by comparing classifications with the conservation outcomes for a large number of existing species for which some populations have gone extinct. The synthesis of these lines of evidence will allow us to evaluate critically the current techniques and to recommend new approaches and testing procedures. 	1999	2002170:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	2	0.142857143	0.5	0.071428571	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.071428571	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0	0.034482759	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0.137931034	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0.034482759	0.172413793	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.103448276	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0.172413793	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2295	" ;Helly, John; "	Computational Ecology	 Purpose of the workshop: 1) to identify significant problems in ecology without regard to limitations imposed by existing research methods and technology and 2) to then assess which of those may be usefully addressed by existing or desired computational technology.

The concept for this workshop is that all BON sites must have one universal grid as well as any other grids they desire but the other grids should tie into the universal grid. The objective for the group is to design a sampling scheme which ensures that data collected at BON sites are comparable across sites and across scales within sites. So the group will develop a multi scale sampling grid that can accommodate microbes to condors and provide a framework for other sampling schemes. Not only will different scales be considered but statistical aspects of the problem will be assessed as well. The workshop will include 10 12 persons to discuss and evaluate various options and make recommendations to NSF for a sampling design. A graduate student or postdoctoral associate will be involved with the group to conduct simulation studies and perform other logistical support. 	1999	1999178:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	2	0	0.494252874	0.068965517	0.068965517	0.022988506	0.022988506	0	0.022988506	0.057471264	0.011494253	0.011494253	0.034482759	0.057471264	0.011494253	0.022988506	0.091954023	0.034965035	0.062937063	0	0	0.006993007	0	0.006993007	0.097902098	0.013986014	0.006993007	0	0.013986014	0	0	0	0	0	0.034965035	0	0.006993007	0	0.377622378	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.097902098	0	0	0.006993007	0	0	0	0	0	0.006993007	0	0	0.013986014	0	0.013986014	0.006993007	0	0.013986014	0	0	0	0.006993007	0	0	0.013986014	0.006993007	0	0	0	0	0.006993007	0	0	0.020979021	0	0	0.006993007	0	0	0.027972028	0	0	0	0.006993007	0.020979021	0	0	0	0.006993007	0	0.006993007	0.013986014	0.027972028	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2400	" ;Rothstein, Stephen; "	Cowbird Management	 A number of North American passerine birds have shown significant declines in recent decades and several species are recognized as federally endangered. In addition to habitat loss and heightened nest predation brood parasitism by the Brown headed Cowbird has been identified as a possible cause of these declines and as a target for management efforts. Two national meetings on cowbird ecology and management in the 1990s have resulted in the exchange and synthesis of a great deal of new knowledge and have also identified a continuing need for dissemination of the latest research findings in this active area of conservation biology. Another need is a national database that will maintain records on the numerous cowbird management efforts currently underway. The National Cowbird Advisory Group has been formed to meet these needs. This group consists of researchers engaged in studies of the biology of cowbirds and their hosts and representatives of governmental agencies concerned with endangered species management and the protection of migratory songbirds. The group has been endorsed by the American Bird Conservancy a consortium of conservation groups and governmental agencies and will provide a focal point for integrating insights methods and effective practices related to cowbird management as part of endangered species recovery efforts or more broadly as part of efforts to enhance overall passerine diversity and conservation. These results will be disseminated to the research and management communities to maintain high professional standards in initiating managing and reviewing cowbird control programs and to facilitate effective information exchange among regional and local programs and among the scientific management and conservation communities. Initial goals of the group will be achieved by holding two workshops at NCEAS funded by the Bureau of Reclamation and designed to produce documents that synthesize the latest results from the research and management communities and that provide guidance for federal state and non governmental organizations concerned with the conservation of passerines. In addition a database will be developed with aid of NCEAS and the U. S.

The inability to easily integrate data becomes critical when the data also have major practical implications for policy planning or decision making. In this proposal we describe a prototype community database repository to accommodate a variety of heterogeneously structured marine ecological data sets. This internet accessible database will provide a valuable data resource for investigators researching long term and large scale ecological processes in the marine environment. The data will come from a multi agency consortium of marine ecologists analysts and data managers who are keen to make their data readily available in a common framework. These data are from academic government foundation and private sources and deal with the rocky intertidal zone at 61 sites throughout central and southern California. Aside from their intrinsic scientific interest these data sets are critical in tracking changes in biological communities and invaluable for guiding and informing the preservation and development of Californias nearshore environment. We will use structured metadata to support query and access to the contents of the database. This will be achieved by implementing an XML based Document Type Definition (DTD) specifically designed for ecological data and called Ecological Metadata Language EML. This content specification is based on recommendations from several committees of ecological researchers and technologists. We will also provide conversion tools that enable researchers to convert EML to HTML or transform EML to two other useful metadata formats Dublin Core and the FGDCs Content Standard for Digital Geospatial Metadata (CSDGM). The prototype database will be developed on a UNIX system and network accessible via the Web. We will strive to develop all tools and services based on open standards and avoid hardware or operating system dependencies. We will also develop software tools that enable scientists to effectively document their own data for contribution to the prototype repository. We will develop some basic data quality control processing routines that will cross check the data contents based on the documentation provided in the metadata. We will also develop extensions to the general ecological content specification that will enhance the utility of these tools for the marine ecology discipline. Our methodology however will be general and extensible permitting future extensions to be developed in support of other specialties. We envision the database repository as the basis for a growing resource that will be invaluable for coastal researchers and policy makers. The insights gained from this information resource will represent novel theoretical and practical advances for ecology as a whole. 	2003	2003219:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	47	2	0.051282051	0.461538462	0.179487179	0.051282051	0.051282051	0	0.051282051	0	0	0	0.051282051	0	0.051282051	0.025641026	0.025641026	0	0.090909091	0.054545455	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0.090909091	0	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0.072727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.036363636	0.018181818	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.072727273	0	0	0.127272727	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0.018181818	0	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0.018181818	0.018181818	0.036363636	0.018181818	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3500	" ;Stine, Peter; Gerrard, Ross; Church, Richard; "	Decision support for conservation planning	 Research effort to improve decision support for habitat conservation planning.

Ecologists may be able to identify a host of beneficial management actions but economics resources (and political will) are rarely sufficient to pursue all of those actions. An important question to address then is the following: Among the many possible actions that can aid the recovery of a species which ones should be given higher priority? In practice these decisions are informed by an ad hoc mixture of biological data demographic theory economic information and politics. Although we cannot improve the political process there is room for substantial improvements in how the economics and ecology are combined when addressing the issue of priorities. First it is worth noting that both ecologists and economists often feel they do address priorities within the context of their own disciplines. For example when ecologists calculate so called elasticities in demographic matrix models the implication is that in doing so they are identifying those opportunities for management that will yield the largest improvements in annual rate of population growth (l) per unit increase in survival. The prominence (and limitation) of this ecological theory aimed at priority setting is highlighted by a recent collection of papers in Ecology (Heppell . 2000). Unfortunately examinations that focus only on demographic parameters and do not explicitly include economics really do not get at the question of   biggest bang for the buck   (BBB). Conversely economists make eminently reasonable sounding recommendations about conservation priorities using cost benefit analyses or perhaps even formal economic optimization algorithms. Unfortunately these purely economic analyses which consider costs and benefits without regard to demographic responses cannot really provide an apt description of net ecological benefits. A gap needs to be closed. We intend to bring together a small group of economists and ecologists to develop formal analytical tools that combine ecological and demographic processes into the same framework and form the question   where do we get the biggest bang for the buck?   in the way we think it should be asked. To ground the theory in the real world we will apply our analyses to two important ecological case studies: managing for the recovery of loggerhead sea turtles in southeastern United States and managing for the recovery of chinook salmon in Northwestern United States. Our project will provide both practical results for real world decisions and the development of methods and theory that combine demographic matrix theory with economic approaches. 	2000	2002223:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	2	2	0.103448276	0.586206897	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0.137931034	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.425	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025	0.025	0	0.075	0	0	0.025	0	0	0	0.025	0.05	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.075	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025	0.1	0	0	0	0	0	0.025	0	0	0	0	0.025	0	0	0.025	0	0.025	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3580	" ;Groves, Craig; "	Drafting a conservation blueprint: A practitioners guide to regional planning for biodiversity	 From July 2000 through June 2001 I will be on sabbatical from my position as Director of Conservation Planning with the Conservation Science Division of The Nature Conservancy (TNC).

A proposed revision of these regulations would extend this requirement to additional species in the plant and animal kingdoms but provide for significant qualifications in the way the requirement is applied to many species in recognition of the natural history and existing condition of those species and their habitat. Since the existing regulation went into effect in 1982 a variety of approaches has been used to meet the viability requirement. Approaches have ranged from opinon based assessments of individual resource specialists to detailed habitat and demographic modeling. many Forest Plans have been challenged on either the adequacy of the management guidelines for species or the adequacy of the process used to demonstrate that viability requirements have been met. The Forest Service is now making a renewed effort to provide consistent and high quality input to forest plans related to viability. The results of this external review will be used in the development of guidance to National Forests for addressing species viability in land and resource management plans. 	2000	2002241:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	2	2	0	0.574074074	0.092592593	0.037037037	0	0.018518519	0	0.037037037	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0.037037037	0	0.166666667	0	0	0.265625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0.046875	0.25	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0.03125	0.078125	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.03125	0.03125	0.015625	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4040	" ;Davis, Frank; Greenwood, Greg; Andelman, Sandy; "	California Legacy Project	 Systematic conservation planning is concerned with developing scientifically guided conservation strategies over large planning areas.

Distributions of vertebrates have been mapped by various authors and institutions at different taxonomic and geographic extent resolution and accuracy. The amount of information and the techniques to handle large quantities of spatial data have now reached a level which would allow data synthesis for this group at a global scale. The aims of the proposed working group are to facilitate accessibility of currently non public datasets to identify and act on filling the remaining gaps of distributional knowledge and to analyze the resulting databases. The benefits are many fold. The synthesis will enable standardized quantification of threat of extinction from small range size alone for all terrestrial vertebrates. It will boost efficiency of large scale conservation priority setting by an unbiased identification of patterns of between site complementarity in species representation. It will allow rapid assessment of vertebrate diversity of regions under threat of change. It will act as a coarse resolution basis for deductive modeling of species fine scale distribution. Furthermore it will allow methodologically rigorous scrutiny of traditional hypotheses of determinants of species distributions and is likely to trigger significant advancement of the field of large scale ecology. The proposed working group shall act as a base for both the necessary data synthesis and subsequent collaborative analysis and dissemination of the compiled data. 	2001	2002265:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	13	2	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4720	" ;Michener, William; "	Partnership for Biodiversity Information		2001	2002270:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	23	2	0.223880597	0.462686567	0.074626866	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.029850746	0.044776119	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.014925373	0.075949367	0.126582278	0	0	0.012658228	0	0	0.063291139	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0	0	0	0.341772152	0	0	0	0	0	0.050632911	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0.012658228	0	0	0.025316456	0.025316456	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.075949367	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.088607595	0.037974684	0.012658228	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4860	" ;Burgman, Mark; "	Setting priorities and making decisions for conservation risk management	 Risk based decisions are made routinely in medicine toxicology engineering psychology insurance and finance. The development of methods in these fields has been rapid but the paths followed and the tools developed have been different. To some extent the differences reflect the kinds of data and the range of problems people need to solve. In part the differences are because methods have grown in relative isolation. A common problem facing practitioners in conservation biology is to identify priorities that discriminate among a suite of alternative actions. Biologists make decisions on a routine basis but with little understanding of the techniques for decisions involving risk. The kinds of questions conservation biologists are obliged to answer will benefit substantially from advances in decision analysis and risk assessment made in other disciplines. This project will develop and expand the toolkit for problem solving available to conservation biologists by reviewing risk based priority setting methods in different fields and bringing together people from different disciplines to examine the problems confronting conservation biologists resulting in new approaches to finding solutions to priority setting and decision making problems. 	2002	2004272:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	29	2	0.076923077	0.346153846	0.192307692	0.230769231	0	0	0.019230769	0.019230769	0.019230769	0	0.019230769	0.038461538	0.019230769	0	0	0.019230769	0	0.101694915	0	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0.13559322	0	0	0.050847458	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0.016949153	0	0	0.016949153	0.152542373	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.050847458	0.033898305	0	0	0.06779661	0	0.06779661	0.033898305	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0	0.016949153	0	0	0.033898305	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		5020	" ;Botsford, Louis; Hastings, Alan; "	Development of tools for the practical design of marine reserves	 We propose a working group to examine the general question of moving from theory to policy specifically looking at the design of marine reserves building on the quantitative results obtained under a previous NCEAS working group   A Theory of Marine Reserves   by J.

For example researchers studying forest composition and dynamics using permanent plots are not all linked to a common database framework although most use similar methods. Climatologists working in Brazil and elsewhere to model Andean climate change are not coordinating their studies with on ground monitoring efforts. In some cases palaeobotanists and vegetation ecologists are coordinating study sites but this is not universal. Remote sensing is used extensively by some groups but not others. Taxonomic databases are not linked to plot data making it expensive and difficult to update determinations and hampering efforts to perform large scale analyses due to poor understanding of data quality among groups. A major set of institutions and research groups operating in the Andes has decided to explore coordination of their activities to overcome organizational obstacles and agree upon questions and strategies to address in a coordinated research effort. The hope is that such a process will lead not only to better analyses of existing data but also enable a targeted intensification of research in places that are changing very quickly. We are proposing an initial organizational meeting at NCEAS January 8 10 2002. Our product will be a model for discussion of a research blueprint that can be readily implemented by collaborative teams working in other areas of the Andes and a plan of follow up action to implement the blueprint for interested collaborators. 	2002	2002279:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	30	2	0	0.166666667	0.166666667	0.166666667	0	0.166666667	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0.142857143	0.142857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0	0.142857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		5261	" ;White, Michael; "	Biocomplexity in a coupled natural and human system: The glassy winged sharpshooter and threats to the California wine industry		2002	20022:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	2	2	0.177777778	0.477777778	0.055555556	0	0.066666667	0.011111111	0.044444444	0	0.022222222	0.011111111	0	0.011111111	0	0.022222222	0.044444444	0.055555556	0.008547009	0.264957265	0.017094017	0	0.076923077	0	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0.008547009	0	0.153846154	0	0.034188034	0.008547009	0	0.034188034	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0.008547009	0.008547009	0	0.017094017	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017094017	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0.008547009	0.051282051	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0.042735043	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.111111111	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017094017	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2002	" ;Andelman, Sandy; "	 Designing and assessing the viability of nature reserve systems at regional scales: Integration of optimization Heuristic and dynamic models 	 A current challenge in biodiversity conservation is to develop effective methods for setting conservation priorities at multiple geographic and spatial scales. Numerous paradigms have been offered for the identification and prioritization of sites for conserving biological diversity at a variety of scales  global national regional local): hotspots; rarity; GAP Analysis; representativeness. However practical application of these these models to guide biodiversity conservation and management activities on the ground can be challenging. For example the theoretical underpinnings of different site selection strategies are often implicit but not stated leading to misunderstandings of implementation requirements; or the data available for a given area may be insufficient to apply a particular model. In other cases the models may be applied inappropriately  in cases where the spatial distribution or other parameters of the data violate critical assumptions of the models). Biodiversity conservation efforts worldwide increasingly emphasize a regional or ecoregional framework for biodviersity inventory and monitoring as well as for the identification and prioritization of potential conservation sites. Within this framework actual conservation investments will be influenced by both the choice of data sets for analysis and the choice of site selection strategies  heuristic vs. optimization; representativeness vs. rarity; complementarity vs. redundancy etc.). Therefore we propose to synthesize several existing large regional spatial datasets (for the Intermountain Semidesert ecoregion of the western U.S. encompassing parts of Washington Oregon Idaho Nevada California Utah Wyoming and Montana) as a means of exploring a set of questions which will inform both theoretical and practical aspects of biodiversity conservation. 	1997	1998310:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	2	2	0.309090909	0.363636364	0.054545455	0	0	0.054545455	0	0.036363636	0.036363636	0.018181818	0.018181818	0.018181818	0.018181818	0.036363636	0	0.036363636	0.132352941	0.191176471	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.117647059	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.132352941	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.117647059	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6760	" ;Pressey, Robert; "	Conservation planning tools	 For the purposes of this working group planning tools are software packages including simple algorithms as well as decision support systems that are used to guide decisions about conservation action.

Simultaneously there has been an explosion in commercial applications of mycorrhizal fungi in agriculture horticulture forestry and ecosystem restoration. Considering the unexpected consequences of many human introductions of non native plants and animals and our current lack of understanding of the factors controlling mutualistic performance of mycorrhizas it is alarming that so little caution is being used in commercial applications of mycorrhizal fungi. Our proposed working group will: 1) perform meta analyses to synthesize the currently disparate body of empirical and theoretical work on mycorrhizal function within communities and ecosystems 2) develop models of mycorrhizal performance with environmental conditions and plant and fungal phenotypes as variables 3) generate recommendations and precautions regarding the commercial use of mycorrhizal inoculum 4) establish an online database that documents inoculation trials and tracks their outcome over time and 5) organize a symposium at an international conference. In addition to contributing to the development of principles to guide mycorrhizal management our efforts will help generate better theories for understanding the roles of mutualisms in population and community dynamics. 	2005	2006368:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	71	2	0	0.418604651	0.11627907	0.046511628	0.023255814	0	0.093023256	0	0.023255814	0	0	0.023255814	0.023255814	0.093023256	0.069767442	0.069767442	0.019607843	0.137254902	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.098039216	0.039215686	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0.019607843	0.058823529	0	0.039215686	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0	0.078431373	0.019607843	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.039215686	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.176470588	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0.019607843					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9100	" ;Griffith, Daniel; Chazdon, Robin; "	Biodiversity and conservation value of agricultural landscapes of Mesoamerica	 This working group will synthesize information from research conducted across eight Mesoamerican countries to elucidate and promote principles for conservation action in human impacted landscapes of Mesoamerica and to enhance the contribution to biodiversity conservation of forest fragments extant agriculture post agricultural secondary forests and forest restoration projects.

Number of publications and their citation frequency are also widely used for academic evaluation of individual researchers departments and universities. Therefore any bias in publication and dissemination of scientific content may potentially affect the development of a field in terms of what kind of information is available for synthesis who is successfully employed and where funding is allocated . We will specifically focus on publication bias in ecology in this working group using meta analysis techniques (and other standard statistics) on several sizeable collections of published papers and related online resources such as citation frequencies and impact factors. We have loosely identified three levels of attributes of the publication and dissemination process in ecology: characteristics of the study (number of hypotheses effect size support for main hypothesis) attributes of the publication itself (merit length number and gender of authors) and attributes of the journal (reputation impact factor circulation). General publication biases identified in medicine and ecology include the file drawer problem overinterpretation bias dissemination bias status bias visibility bias and gender bias. Few synthetic studies however have quantitatively tested the importance of these proposed biases nor related these biases to specific attributes of the publication process. Furthermore there has been no quantitative evaluation of the relative importance and potential interactions between these factors. 	2005	200837:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	2	0.052631579	0.263157895	0.052631579	0	0.052631579	0	0.052631579	0.210526316	0	0	0	0.210526316	0	0.052631579	0	0.052631579	0.649122807	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.052631579	0	0	0	0.035087719	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.035087719	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2059	" ;Jones, Matthew; Davis, Frank; Reichman, O.; Schildhauer, Mark; "	Automation of ecological data management using structured metadata	 Data management is a key element in facilitating synthetic ecological research and thus constitutes an important focus of efforts for NCEAS. Researchers at NCEAS must integrate large numbers of arbitrarily structured and poorly documented data sets. It is critically important that NCEAS investigators in collaboration with the Centers technical staff prepare and organize information about these data to facilitate appropriate use and dissemination of the synthesized databases. While some work has been completed towards the development of standards for ecological metadata relatively little has been done on issues surrounding the technological implementation of a system that could make use of those content standards. We propose to use Standardized General Markup Language (SGML) to formalize a content standard for ecological metadata and then to build a suite of automated data management tools written in Java that use this formalized standard. These software tools for documentation and quality control work must be easy to use for the typical ecologist thereby allowing them to focus on ecological questions rather than database technologies.  	1997	1999391:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	2	0	0.702702703	0.108108108	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0.027027027	0.054054054	0.027027027	0.027027027	0.027027027	0	0.268292683	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.317073171	0.12195122	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9982	" ;Kareiva, Peter; Possingham, Hugh; Murdoch, William; "	International conservation: Expanding the decision framework	Conservation agencies are planning massive expansion of their conservation activities in the largely tropical developing world.

The ultimate value of monitoring data however is highly dependent on the quality of the monitoring program. While numerous studies have evaluated the power of monitoring programs for specific populations few general rules exist for how to optimally allocate monitoring effort. The optimal allocation of monitoring effort should depend on general characteristics of a species life history  fecundity and longevity) and on statistical aspects of population dynamics  spatial and temporal variation and autocorrelation). Therefore it should be possible to develop general guidelines for the optimal design of monitoring programs based on measurable population parameters. I propose to use simulation models to derive general quantitative guidelines for the design of population monitoring programs. Specifically my research will address the following questions: 1) What aspects of life history or population dynamics determine the optimal monitoring strategy for a given population? 2) What amount of baseline data is necessary to choose an appropriate population monitoring strategy? 3) If an existing monitoring program is poorly designed when is it optimal to start over with a better program? The answers to these questions will provide rigorous and practical guidelines for the design of monitoring strategies and should lead to improved assessments of population trends and processes. 	2006	2007427:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	23	2	0.224137931	0.431034483	0.086206897	0.017241379	0.068965517	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0.034482759	0.073529412	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.117647059	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0.323529412	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0.044117647	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		11103	" ;Sarkar, Sahotra; Regan, Helen; "	Making decisions on complex environmental problems	 Environmental scientists must often facilitate complex decision making based on scientific data but subject to societal and other constraints on management options.

However CAD techniques currently cannot evaluate factors that allow species and their resources to persist over time. These factors include land cover connectivity and the resilience of reserve networks to ecological processes such as fire. Several new methods for CAD are emerging that have the potential to improve greatly on past methods. These new methods are unfamiliar to most practitioners and no comparative evaluation of their usefulness in different contexts exists. Participants will test and compare new tools by applying them to conservation planning challenges in several geographic areas in North America. Participants also will develop a manual that evaluates new software tools for connectivity analysis with guidelines for use of those tools. Ultimately the group will develop a software toolkit and guidelines for its use that would be applicable to landscape scale conservation planning in any region. 	2007	2008465:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	2	0.1	0.15	0.05	0	0.15	0	0.05	0.1	0.05	0	0.1	0	0.05	0.05	0.15	0	0.50877193	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0	0.035087719	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.087719298	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.035087719	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.052631579	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12097	" ;Vieglais, David; "	 Evaluating the role of current semantic web technologies for improving discovery accessibility and interoperability of ecological and environmental data 	 The Semantic Web offers the potential for previously unrealized level of data integration for scientists working on complex interrelated data sets such as are commonly found in biodiversity and ecological studies.

The subject of our research is the development of an innovative optimization modeling approach to selecting lands to set aside for habitat conservation. Our data and pilot study come from the eastern parts of Contra Costa and Alameda Counties in Northern California a region that encapsulates state wide and nation wide issues of finding alternatives for conserving habitats amid growth pressures cost constraints and a prevalence of private ownership. Our approach differs from previous reserve siting models in that we invest in a substantial amount of biological input so that the spatial units selected by the optimization model have been pre defined to be suitable for supporting species. This front end investment in defining appropriate biological parameters is accomplished and coordinated using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). In addition the cost of preserving habitats at various locations is defined and stored using GIS. This biological and cost information undergoes significant processing and is ultimately used to define a mathematical programming model that selects habitat patches or territories (as opposed to the arbitrary spatial units used in almost all other such models). The math programming model can select a desired number of habitat patches based on objectives of minimizing acquisition cost maximizing patch connectivity and other objectives. We believe that our framework of combining our team strengths in expert biological opinion optimization modeling and GIS has achieved a significant synthesis and that considerably more progress can be achieved with an additional year of support.  	1998	1998493:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	2	0.02173913	0.304347826	0.043478261	0.02173913	0.086956522	0.282608696	0.02173913	0.065217391	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0.02173913	0.086956522	0	0.034482759	0.206896552	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.189655172	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0.172413793	0	0.068965517	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12134	" ;Fleishman, Erica; "	Wild salmon ecosystems	 Climate is a major driver of the geographic distribution and abundance of salmon.

Recent rapid advances in molecular genetic techniques make it relatively easy and inexpensive to quantify temporal changes in the genetics of populations over tens or even hundreds of years. However it is currently unknown under what circumstances genetic monitoring would provide valuable information or what genetic data are required for effective genetic monitoring. We propose a working group that will address these issues in order to provide guidance for resource managers and policy makers. We will also evaluate the potential for using genetic monitoring of candidate genes likely to be affected by climate change and other forms of stress in order to understand evolutionary responses to environmental changes. The results of this working group will be rigorous and practical guidelines for the design of genetic monitoring strategies and should lead to improved assessments of population trends and evolutionary processes. 	2008	2009517:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	2	0.105263158	0.140350877	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0.035087719	0.122807018	0.105263158	0.035087719	0.035087719	0.052631579	0.070175439	0.035087719	0.087719298	0.087719298	0.052631579	0.019607843	0	0	0.009803922	0	0	0	0.068627451	0	0	0	0	0.009803922	0.019607843	0.088235294	0	0	0.098039216	0.009803922	0.068627451	0.009803922	0	0.019607843	0	0.088235294	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009803922	0.088235294	0	0	0	0.078431373	0	0.019607843	0	0.039215686	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0.049019608	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.019607843	0.029411765	0.009803922	0	0.039215686	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12218	" ;Woods, Kerry; "	Slow systems and complex data sets: Multi decade permanent plots permit address of recalcitrant questions about late successional forests	 Long standing (and often conflicting) hypotheses about processes in late successional forest communities remain effectively untested because existing data sets are inadequate for analysis of very slow processes. Usual approaches are of limited power because they employ assumption laden indirect methods or data sets of low precision and resolution. Large multi decade spatially explicit data from systems of permanent plots in old growth forests in Michigan afford the potential for rigorous address of a range of important but recalcitrant questions. Are community and population processes stabilizing and convergent or non equilibrial and historically contingent? Is diversity maintained by equilibrial or non equilibrial processes? How do frequency and scale of different types of disturbance interact with population dynamics and interactions? Are tree growth and biomass accumulation related to diversity? How do spatial and temporal scale and resolution affect answers to these questions? The data set while uniquely appropriate for assessing these questions is also very complex irregular in structure and complexly stratified in time and space posing daunting methodological challenges. This project has two general goals that will make use of the distinctive resources and mission of NCEAS. First I hope to collaborate with NCEAS staff and guests in developing and applying models and analytic approaches appropriate to these research questions and commensurate with the properties of the data set (I particularly hope to establish ongoing collaborations).

Given the ubiquity and importance of this interaction understanding the controls on its variability is paramount for basic and applied ecology. One centerpiece activity of a previous NCEAS working group ( Bridging the gap between theory and practice in mycorrhizal management 2005 2007) was to initiate an effort to understand this ecological variability through an empirical synthesis of mycorrhizal inoculation experiments. As part of that effort we created a database of nearly 2000 such experiments and developed innovative new methods for multi factor meta analysis to assess the relative importance of numerous biotic and abiotic factors hypothesized to explain variation among experiments in plant responses to mycorrhizal inoculation. Although important insights were gained from that analysis it revealed limitations of the approach (detailed below) which prevented the full exploitation of that effort. Through the NCEAS distributed graduate network project proposed here we plan to address these limitations to answer fundamental questions about context dependency in the mycorrhizal symbiosis (detailed below). In this process graduate students will be trained in mycorrhizal ecology data management ecoinformatics and statistical meta analysis and will have the opportunity to take the lead in meaningful synthetic ecological science.

Ecological theory and complex often spatially explicit computer simulations are two ways in which ecologists have attempted to help managers solve conservation problems. Both methods have provided little guidance. Ecological theory is simple enough to be general but lacks the constraints and trade offs to be usefully applied in the real world. Complex computer simulations target specific ecosystems ad problems (are not general) require many parameters that may be hard to estimate and the robustness of the ensuing decisions may take years of simulating to evaluate. The primary purpose of this sabbatical will be to use existing work on the application of formal optimism tools like stochastic dynamic programming to develop simple and robust   rules of thumb   for two major conservation problems disturbance management and metapopulation management. In its grandest sense I wish to outline a theory of applied conservation biology something which I believe does not exist.This research proposal arises from an NCEAS working group on population management held in August 1997 (Shea Mangel and Possingham).

This proposal summarizes progress to date and outlines the research we propose for a second year of NCEAS support (July 1998 June 1999). 	1998	199994:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	2	0.038461538	0.134615385	0.096153846	0.019230769	0.134615385	0.115384615	0.076923077	0	0.076923077	0.076923077	0	0.057692308	0	0	0.076923077	0.096153846	0.131578947	0.039473684	0	0	0	0	0	0.013157895	0.039473684	0.092105263	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0.013157895	0	0.039473684	0	0	0	0.197368421	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0.013157895	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013157895	0	0	0	0	0.039473684	0	0	0.144736842	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013157895	0	0.013157895	0	0	0.013157895	0.013157895	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013157895	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.065789474	0	0	0.013157895	0.013157895	0	0.013157895					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2151	" ;Dadd, Michael; "	Species 2000 Project	 The Species 2000 programme has the aim of creating a uniform and validated index to the worlds known species for use as a practical tool in inventorying and monitoring biodiversity worldwide.

It is used as a safety net to determine whether controversial environmental decisions are working as a baseline to keep track of our ecosystems health and as a source of data for fundamental research. Unfortunately the data from monitoring programs are terribly under used because the programs are ill designed because tools for using the data remain primitive and simply because of a lack of awareness about the possibilities. In the past ecologists have tended to view monitoring as dull and without intellectual content. This notion is changing but not fast enough. I aim to write a book on ecological monitoring that does three things: 1.) improves our   technology   for using monitoring data when testing hypotheses about environmental degradation 2.) suggests how the design of monitoring programs might be improved so that they better serve a hypothesis testing framework 3.) illustrates how monitoring can be interesting in a basic and applied setting and catalyzes more work in the area.  	1998	1998105:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	5	3	0	0	0.333333333	0.166666667	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2171	" ;Kareiva, Peter; "	Developing a modeling paradigm for spatially explicit urban ecology models		1998	1998153:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	40	3	0.052631579	0.052631579	0.157894737	0	0	0	0	0	0.157894737	0.052631579	0	0.052631579	0.157894737	0.105263158	0.157894737	0.052631579	0.047619048	0	0.047619048	0.047619048	0.047619048	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0.047619048	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047619048	0.095238095	0	0	0	0	0.095238095	0	0.095238095	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047619048	0.047619048	0	0.095238095	0.047619048	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2268	" ;Tilman, David; Levin, Simon; Brown, James; Holling, Crawford; "	Universal Phenomena in Ecology?

Privately owned lands comprise the majority of the land in the United States as well as in most federal democracies of the world but most past emphasis upon ecosystem applications has been focused upon public lands. Private lands require unique consideration relative to their focused management goals diverse scales of management within constraints of ownership boundaries and the processes and problems that traverse ownership boundaries within a landscape. Scales often preferred by ecologists for natural reserves or large publicly owned tracts such as species ranges or watersheds are inadequate by themselves. Private lands and their diversity of ownerships provide the challenge of working with very different concepts of open systems linkages and boundaries as well as with very different social and economic considerations.  	1996	1996156:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0	0	0.25	0	0	0.25	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2276	" ;Seastedt, Timothy; "	Association of Ecosystem Research Centers Annual Meeting		1996	1996157:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0.034482759	0	0.344827586	0.103448276	0.103448276	0.034482759	0.034482759	0.034482759	0.068965517	0	0.068965517	0.103448276	0.034482759	0	0	0.034482759	0.052631579	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.184210526	0	0.026315789	0	0.026315789	0	0	0.026315789	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0.052631579	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0.052631579	0	0	0	0.052631579	0.131578947	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.078947368	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.052631579	0.052631579	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2278	" ;Pace, Michael; "	Establishing Structure for the Synthesis and Integration of Progress in Ecosystem Science	 We are beginning a major synthesis effort to evaluate   successes limitations and frontiers in ecosystem science.

We propose to examine what we believe are more foundational issues than previous workshops. Here are some of the issues that have surfaced: To what extent is a fundamental reevaluation of economic theory warranted by considering ecological constraints. Many economists believe that ecology can be properly dealt with simply by accounting for environmental externalities and therefore is not a topic on which major new theoretical work is needed. Ecologists tend to suppose that economic theory just cant deal with ecological reality and that fundamental revision of economic theory will be needed before it can be applied to the environment. Clearly both positions are incorrect. Many topics that ecologists feel are uniquely difficult to deal with including valuation of life and lives the role of ethical stands and intergenerational equity have in fact been the subject of active economic research for some time irrespective of ecology. On the other hand production functions used in economic models are often of a form that omits feedbacks between economic growth and the availability of environmental goods and services and general equilibrium models rarely consider the intricate interdependencies inherent in the ecological system. At least some basic economic models are bound to be greatly altered when ecological processes are included. Therefore a major task of the workshop will be to sort out where ecological information will make a fundamental difference to economic theory and where existing economic theory of particular relevance to the environment can be readily adapted to this domain. Specific topics planned for discussion include role of ecological constraints (including dynamic constraints) on general equilibrium and welfare theory growth theory and trade theory. To what extent is there a general theory or approach to subsume renewable services including harvestable resources together with what might be called renewable hazards? In particular are there general principles unifying the management of fisheries forest and land with the management of crop pests and human infectious diseases? And more specifically to what extent do detailed ecological models exist that can used to refine economic models of renewable and exhaustible resources? How is a cost benefit analysis of environmental goods and services to be carried out? The US Congress is presently mandating that costs as well as benefits be considered in environmental legistation. How should this be done? Related issues are how to conduct accounting including national accounting that includes the environment; and the relative merits of contingent and hedonic valuation in accounting. Should cost benefit analysis of environmental regulations include intergenerational equity and if so how? What is the economic justification for environmental regulation? Environmental regulations are often criticized as retarding growth and economic progress. Under what contexts does environmental regulation promote economic growth? Are regulations that manage a renewable resource such as a forest or fishery for maximum revenue regulations that prohibit environmental damage as in air and water pollution and regulations that require vaccinations against infectious diseases special cases of a general theory for managing common resources? To what extent can ecological considerations be represented in terms of common resources so that regulation can be done (at least in principle) using well developed methods for managing common property. To the extent that this paradigm cannot be applied we will seek new methods. What is sustainable development? To what extent are ecological models reliable enough to predict what is sustainable? How if at all do economists and ecologists differ in their concepts of sustainablity?  	1996	1996175:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	3	0.090909091	0.038961039	0.207792208	0.064935065	0.038961039	0.103896104	0	0.051948052	0.142857143	0.025974026	0.012987013	0.038961039	0.012987013	0.103896104	0.064935065	0	0.018691589	0.009345794	0.018691589	0	0.009345794	0	0	0.018691589	0	0.028037383	0.065420561	0	0	0.140186916	0	0	0.009345794	0.102803738	0	0	0	0.018691589	0.009345794	0	0.018691589	0	0	0	0.056074766	0.037383178	0	0	0	0.08411215	0	0	0	0.018691589	0.028037383	0	0.037383178	0	0	0	0	0	0.037383178	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018691589	0.037383178	0.018691589	0	0.037383178	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0.018691589	0.009345794	0.018691589	0.028037383	0	0	0	0	0.009345794	0.009345794	0	0.009345794	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2308	" ;Hart, Stephen; "	Analysis and synthesis of the historical range of variability in ecosystem structure and function of inland west forests: Implications for ecological restoration 	 Management activities such as fire suppression overgrazing and selective logging since Euro American settlement of the Inland West have resulted in forest ecosystems that are in a poor ecological condition. Current proposals to restore these forest ecosystems to their presettlement conditions suffer from the lack of a comprehensive assessment of the historical range of variability in ecosystem structures and functions of these forests. As a Resident Fellow at NCEAS on sabbatical leave from Northern Arizona University I propose to conduct a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of the current state of knowledge regarding the historical range of variability of forest ecosystems of the Inland West. This analysis will include published manuscripts in professional journals public documents from land management agencies and unpublished data contained in graduate student theses or archived in researchers databases. Other quantitative data such as those from early land survey records or qualitative data such as repeat photography will also be collected and analyzed. Process based ecological simulation models will be used to assess changes in ecological attributes since Euro American settlement and to predict alterations in these attributes following restoration treatments (such as thinning and prescribed burning). Existing experimental data will be used to help verify simulation predictions. This comprehensive synthesis will aid land managers in predicting the potential impact of restoration efforts on ecosystem health in different forest types and evaluate the transportability of restoration practices across forests of the Inland West.  	1997	1998185:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	29	3	0.033898305	0.06779661	0.491525424	0	0.033898305	0.016949153	0.169491525	0.033898305	0	0	0.016949153	0.033898305	0	0.016949153	0.06779661	0.016949153	0.013333333	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.04	0.013333333	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0.026666667	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.333333333	0.04	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.093333333	0.013333333	0	0.213333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0.013333333	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2620	" ;Crone, Elizabeth; Schultz, Cheryl; Holl, Karen; "	Restoration in a Landscape Context	 Current restoration activities often focus narrowly on sites actively being restored. The success of these restorations however will often depend on their position in the landscape relative to the condition land use and community composition of land in the surrounding area. Restoration ecologists have often discussed landscape level processes in general. Nonetheless theory has rarely led to recommendations that are put to use on the ground. We propose to address the process of the exchange of information from academic theory to applied management in the following ways. First we will synthesize what has been written about landscape level processes that affect restoration and about statistical and modeling tools that can be used to judge restoration success. Then we will use the synthesis to address two landscape level restoration projects one population focused habitat restoration and the second a community focused ecosystem restoration. We will develop new quantitative methods to prioritize what landscape level concerns will significantly affect the success of restoration efforts in these and other projects. The purpose of this working group will be to move beyond broad generalizations and ask how we can apply relevant ecological knowledge to large scale restoration activities. 	2000	2002191:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	7	3	0.08	0.115	0.31	0.01	0.015	0.045	0.005	0.005	0.015	0.22	0.025	0.05	0.025	0.045	0.02	0.015	0.004587156	0.02293578	0	0.004587156	0.073394495	0.004587156	0.229357798	0	0.013761468	0	0.02293578	0	0	0.009174312	0.064220183	0	0	0.032110092	0	0	0	0	0.041284404	0	0.013761468	0.004587156	0.004587156	0	0.018348624	0.004587156	0	0	0	0.050458716	0	0	0	0	0.004587156	0	0	0.027522936	0	0.004587156	0	0.004587156	0.050458716	0.009174312	0	0	0	0.004587156	0	0	0	0.004587156	0	0.004587156	0.009174312	0.018348624	0.013761468	0	0	0	0	0.146788991	0.041284404	0	0	0.004587156	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.004587156	0	0	0.009174312	0	0	0.009174312	0	0	0.009174312	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2784	" ;Kerr, Suzi; Pfaff, Alexander; "	 A dynamic integrated model of land use carbon flows and carbon sequestration supply in Costa Rica 	 With the rise in importance of global climate change society is actively exploring the possibility of using forest ecosystems as a carbon sink. Tropical forests may offer over two thirds of such opportunities. The protection of tropical forests could offset global fossil fuel C emissions and reduce the cost of emissions limitations set in Kyoto. Certified emissions credits (CERs) under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) established in Kyoto will likely incorporate tropical forest sinks within efforts to meet emissions targets. While this could in principle result in significant economic and sequestration benefits actual evidence on tropical C sinks is sparse. However society must soon make key decisions concerning tropical forest sinks in the CDM. The first major goal of our project is to estimate how much C sequestration will be generated in Costa Rica in response to any given monetary reward for C sequestration. Our advances in the ecological and economic components will be coupled to produce our first integrated output an estimated supply or equivalently cost function for C sequestration  a relationship between the C reward and the C sequestration supplied by land users). Our advances in the economic component start with excellent existing GIS databases on land use and land cover and on the factors expected to affect land use choices. We will extend both of these types of data sets in particular extending land cover information back in time and adding improved data on land returns. Next we will both apply and extend the frontier of economic observationally based modeling of land use to provide a map from key factors to land choices. On the ecological side our advances start with systematic and comprehensive measurement of aboveground and soil C present within the range of forest ecosystems of Costa Rica as well as the C dynamics within land use gradients of each of those systems  pastures croplands and secondary forests of varying ages). With this and existing data we will calibrate and verify both process based and empirically based ecological models that generate C predictions of varying complexity. This provides a map to C stocks from land use choices within different ecosystems. Our second goal is to contribute to the effective design of the rules that allow C sequestration in tropical locations to replace emissions reductions in developed countries. Our analyses will provide the necessary information for the baselines that permit CERs to be defined and a C market to function. We will also perform integrated sensitivity analyses to determine whether simplified versions of our disciplinary and integrated models maintain sufficient accuracy. Sufficient accuracy will ensure the sequestration outcomes envisioned while greater simplicity which translates to lower costs of participation in trading will stimulate further participation lowering costs and raising efficiency of implementation of the Kyoto emissions limitations. In order to achieve these goals we need to closely integrate the economic and ecology work creating dynamic feedbacks between physical and ecological characteristics of land and human land use choices. We also need to integrate the process based and empirical ecological models to maximize the complementarities between them. 	2001	2003193:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	3	0.014285714	0.014285714	0.542857143	0.028571429	0.042857143	0.057142857	0.057142857	0.042857143	0.028571429	0.014285714	0	0	0.057142857	0.014285714	0.071428571	0.014285714	0.304812834	0	0.005347594	0	0	0	0	0.026737968	0	0	0.016042781	0	0.005347594	0.005347594	0.048128342	0	0	0.037433155	0	0.005347594	0.005347594	0.112299465	0	0	0.032085561	0.016042781	0	0.005347594	0.010695187	0	0.005347594	0	0.010695187	0	0.005347594	0	0	0.106951872	0.010695187	0.016042781	0.037433155	0.016042781	0	0	0	0	0.010695187	0	0	0.016042781	0.010695187	0.005347594	0.005347594	0.005347594	0	0.005347594	0	0	0	0	0.032085561	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010695187	0	0	0.010695187	0.010695187	0.010695187	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.005347594	0.016042781	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2840	" ;Willig, Michael; Brunt, James; Helly, John; Jones, Matthew; Reichman, O.; "	A Knowledge Network for Biocomplexity: Building and evaluating a metadata based framework for integrating heterogeneous scientific data	 Complexity is an inherent property of living systems that arises from direct and indirect interactions among the earths physical chemical and biological components. Biocomplexity includes the structural and functional attributes of dynamic systems that arise at all levels of biological organization including individuals populations and communities. Importantly ecological components of biocomplexity  biodiversity ecosystem services) are in crisis and are undergoing potentially irreversible changes in the face of rapid human population growth and economic development. Wise stewardship based on all available scientific knowledge concerning these natural systems is essential. Data Catalyzed by these societal concerns and facilitated by technology advances scientists focused on complex ecological systems have generated an explosion of ecological and environmental data. When integrated with data from other disciplines  meteorology) these data have the potential to greatly enhance understanding of biocomplexity. However broad scale and synthetic research is stymied because these data are largely inaccessible due to their spatial dispersion extreme structural and semantic heterogeneity and complexity.  I Knowledge Networking  i  We propose to integrate the distributed and heterogeneous information sources required for the development and testing of theory in ecology and its sister fields into a standards based open architecture knowledge network. The network will extend recent advances in metadata representation to provide conceptually sophisticated access to integrated data products drawn from distributed autonomous data repositories. In addition the knowledge network will include advanced tools for exploring complex data sets from which multiple formulations of hypotheses can be tested. The existence of such a network will lead to broadened understanding of biocomplexity and ecological systems and allow the application of that understanding to societal issues. In developing this network we will create a new community of environmental scientists who will be able to focus on complex multi scale problems that to date have proven to be intractable. We will perform foundational research in computer science and informatics to create new tools for discovering retrieving interpreting integrating and analyzing data from these diverse sources. Our prototype network will be useful across a variety of disciplines and will provide a basis for the growth of multidisciplinary research groups focused on biocomplexity.  I Collaboration  i  To accomplish these goals we have created an intellectual consortium that comprises the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) the Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER) and the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC). Our partnership has a successful history and includes (1) advanced expertise in ecology informatics and computer science (2) a comprehensive understanding of the critical obstacles that data heterogeneity and dispersion create for advancing synthesis and understanding and (3) strong commitments to addressing those obstacles that deter broad scale and synthetic analyses. Impact The results of the proposed research will have broad implications for our ability to understand and manage sustainably the complex ecological systems and biological resources on which all humans depend. Information on biocomplexity is voluminous and complex but currently is inaccessible to research scientists and policy makers. The intellectual advances in information science that we propose will for the first time provide an accessible infrastructure for identifying integrating managing and ultimately synthesizing the nations ecological and biodiversity information resources.

The Conservation and Restoration Biology Program has had relatively few proposals submitted and funded on restoration even though the field of restoration is growing rapidly and is in need of a stronger conceptual basis. Restoration may be considered an experimental tool for understanding the functioning of ecological systems but the promise of the contribution restoration ecology can make has not been fulfilled. There are literally thousands of restoration projects throughout the country with many opportunities for restoration research on already prepared sites. However the number of these projects in which researchers collaborate remains relatively small. The goals of the workshop are to encourage more scientists to write high quality proposals and engage in restoration research and to involve practicing restorationists in scientific studies. A major theme is changing the emphasis in restoration from an anecdotal to a scientific approach. A two day workshop will be organized hierarchically to discuss organismal community ecosystem and landscape level issues that are particular to restoration. We propose to discuss whether there are conceptual challenges that are particular to restoration that we do not find in other areas of ecology or biology and determine some of the underlying principles of restoration. The contributions that practicing restorationists may make to the field of restoration ecology will also be covered and what we may learn from the many existing restoration projects that have not been monitored or studied in any depth. A special area of emphasis will be the building of partnerships between practitioners and theorists to improve practice and research in restoration. The products of the workshop will be a set of recommendations to NSF to improve the quality and quantity of proposals that are submitted and a set of published papers that expand upon the themes discussed at the workshop. 	1996	1996203:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	25	3	0.146666667	0	0.226666667	0	0.066666667	0	0.053333333	0.16	0.066666667	0.04	0.12	0.013333333	0.026666667	0.026666667	0.013333333	0.04	0.038834951	0	0	0.106796117	0.067961165	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.058252427	0	0	0.019417476	0	0	0	0	0	0.019417476	0.194174757	0	0	0.029126214	0.029126214	0	0	0	0.019417476	0	0.009708738	0.038834951	0	0.009708738	0	0	0.048543689	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0	0	0.067961165	0	0	0.029126214	0	0	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.009708738	0	0	0.019417476	0	0.009708738	0	0.077669903	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029126214	0	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0	0.009708738	0.019417476					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3080	" ;de Valpine, Perry; "	Analysis of insect population data with structured population models	 Agricultural pest control relies on understanding complex communities of herbivores and their natural enemies. Field experiments of agricultural communities have produced voluminous multi species spatiotemporal population data. However conventional data analysis uses model frameworks that lack biological structure and thus are only indirectly related to the hypothesized processes of birth death predation and movement. This project will use population models to analyze extensive existing data from three agricultural insect communities and one protist microcosm experiment. The questions for each system are 1) Is there evidence for particular movement behaviors? 2) Is there evidence of particular species interactions? The study systems are 1) pea aphids and natural enemies in Wisconsin alfalfa 2) cotton aphids other herbivores and natural enemies in California of cotton 3) whiteflies and natural enemies in Arizona cotton and 4) protist predator and prey in laboratory microcosms.

This work will address a fundamental question of ecology   When does the spatial arrangement of habitats matter for the functioning of ecosystem processes?   and will provide critical information for managers regarding strategic land acquisition. 	2000	2003207:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0.064516129	0.016129032	0.322580645	0.048387097	0.032258065	0	0.064516129	0.096774194	0.016129032	0	0.096774194	0.129032258	0.016129032	0	0.064516129	0.032258065	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0.272727273	0.015151515	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0.045454545	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.015151515	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.136363636	0	0	0.015151515	0	0.03030303	0	0.090909091	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3240	" ;Post, David; "	How does turnover time structure affect ecosystem stability?	 Ecosystem stability is a basic ecological concept with important implications for the exploitation management and restoration of ecosystems subject to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Much contemporary research has focused on understanding how food web characteristics such as species diversity and food chain length affect ecosystem stability. Ecosystem stability can also be affected by the turnover times (or generation times) of key ecosystem components. There are striking differneces in turnover times of ecosystem components in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems; however there is currently no empirical or theoretical framework for assessing how these differences affect ecosystem stability. I propose to use a combination of literature analysis and simulation modeling to understand how turnover times differ among ecosystems and how the general differences affect two important components of ecosystem stability resistance and resilience. By working broadly in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems I hope to develop and test general patterns and principles concerning how the turnover times of ecosystem components are related to stability. 	2000	2002217:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	3	0.073170732	0.170731707	0.414634146	0.048780488	0	0.097560976	0	0.048780488	0	0.048780488	0	0	0.024390244	0.024390244	0.048780488	0	0	0.137931034	0.034482759	0	0	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0	0	0.051724138	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.172413793	0.155172414	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0	0.086206897	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0.051724138	0	0.017241379	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3440	" ;Clark, James; "	Ecological Forecasting	 This workshop will develop the science agenda for an initiative in Ecological Forecasting. Within this initiative we define Ecological Forecasting as the process of predicting the state of ecosystems ecosystem services and natural capital based on scenarios for climate changing atmosphere and nutrient cycles and socioeconomic activities. Forecasts address areas ranging from regions to the globe and time horizons of 10 to 100 years. The unprecedented threats to human civilization posed by continuing deterioration of ecosystem services and rapid decline in biodiversity is the basis for ESAs decision to make Ecological Forecasting a research priority. We believe that planning and decision making can be improved by access to reliable forecasts. This first workshop is funded by the National Science Foundation to set a science agenda for Ecological Forecasting. The workshop will assess the readiness of our science to provide ecological forecasts for diverse types of ecosystems. It will identify the basic research questions that must be addressed in order to improve the state of the art. It will consider the mechanisms that might be effective in developing the needed research such as novel ways of fostering interdisciplinary collaboration focusing collaborations on ecological forecasting and making the forecasts useful and informative to decision makers and the general public. 	2000	2000244:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	15	3	0.022727273	0.227272727	0.272727273	0.136363636	0.045454545	0	0.022727273	0	0.022727273	0	0.090909091	0.045454545	0.090909091	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.051724138	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0.086206897	0	0.034482759	0.120689655	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.120689655	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.034482759	0.051724138	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.017241379	0	0.017241379	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.051724138	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4160	" ;Francis, Robert; Kitchell, James; "	Models of alternative management policies for marine ecosystems	 We are employing comparative approaches based on a common modeling framework developed for each of five large marine ecosystems in the North Pacific Ocean.

It is now known that riparian zones strongly influence land water interactions provide habitat for an unusual number of species adjust community level characteristics to specific landforms and are well adapted to physical as well as biological disturbance regimes. These and other characteristics have resulted in the widespread use of riparian zones as prescriptions for landscape management. The purpose of this proposal is to seek support as a Center Fellow to prepare a synthesis volume on The Ecology and Uses of Riparian Zones. The synthesis would be published as a book suitable for instruction at the University level as well as a reference for professional managers. Henri D camps (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique France) will co author the synthesis volume while the overall activity will be guided by a working group of five colleagues.

Economists also need to know better whether and in what ways market and non market mechanisms can realize some of the economic value of biodiversity and provide incentives for its conservation. To progress on these goals in April 2000 the convenors invited a select group of economists working in related areas to prepare papers on the subject for presentation at the workshop. We have also arranged for these papers to be published in a special issue of the journal Resource and Energy Economics. It is important to emphasize that this is a novel research area; consequently we have given authors approximately a year to develop their ideas culminating in a workshop to be held in the Spring of 2001. Because of the unusual nature of the topic it would seem highly productive to expose authors to working versions of all the papers as well as discussion. Furthermore we hope to involve ecologists as discussants in order to assure realistic representation of non economics processes. As an incentive the papers will ultimately be refereed and published (assuming the refereeing process is positive) in one of the leading field journals in the environmental and resource economics field: Resource and Energy Economics. 	2001	2001264:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	29	3	0.147058824	0.147058824	0.588235294	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0	0.03125	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0.125	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0.015625	0.0625	0	0	0	0.421875	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.046875	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0.046875	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4700	" ;Allan, J.

The implications of environmental variation in any particular situation vary depending on climatic processes ecosystem responses and land use patterns. Consequently it is necessary to understand potential interactions between these factors in order to design conservation strategies that use variation to reduce risk and take advantage of opportunities to increase species persistence. Informed action can offset the natural tendency for risk from environmental variation to increase as the total amount of habitat in a landscape decreases. The proposed research addresses this issue by: (1) simulating how climate ecosystems and land use interact over time to change patterns of environmental variation and (2) applying this framework to evaluate risks faced by vernal pool ecosystems in the Central Valley of California. The results of this work will help conservationists develop better tools for reserve design understand processes underlying patterns of environmental variability and manage local vernal pool landscapes to reduce risks associated with landscape and climate change. 	2002	2004305:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	61	3	0.06	0	0.62	0.04	0	0.04	0.02	0.06	0.04	0	0.02	0	0.06	0	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.055555556	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0.018518519	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0.018518519	0	0.037037037	0.037037037	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0.092592593	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.111111111	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6640	" ;Hochberg, Michael; "	Patterns in social behavior and cultural diversity	 The tragedy of the commons describes how individualism can result in hardship to a population as a whole. In an alternative scenario collective action potential competitors are better off cooperating for a common good even if it is not obviously in their short term individual interests. What can shift a tragedy of the commons scenario to one of collective action in human societies? Given complex social environments influenced by governments and media migrations of peoples over different scales and interactions among individuals who may be family friends or perfect strangers how can we ever hope to understand cooperation and attempt to nurture the factors promoting it? Despite a blossoming interest in theories of human cooperation surprisingly there has been no serious assessment of whether human societies should show characteristic patterns in social behavior and cultural diversity.

This will require harnessing the explosion of available environmental knowledge technology and computational tools as well as stimulating the expansion of cooperation among diverse groups of researchers managers and policy makers. The ecology of the future must explain and predict our shared environment apply that predictive power to solve major societal problems and increase fundamental knowledge about humans AND the natural world. Accomplishing these visions will require revolutionary changes among the ecological scientific community and ESAs future agenda. Translate the visions statement into a series of discrete measurable objectives each of which is linked to an extensive action plan for the society. The committee goal will be reached through extensive communication with ESA leadership ESA membership and representatives from government agencies policy makers NGOs and private foundations. 	2003	2003326:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7520	" ;Hibbard, Kathy; "	Ecosystem model data intercomparison working group IV		2003	200332:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	3	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2050	" ;Courtney, Steven; "	Sustainable Ecological Institute		1998	1998336:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	53	3	0.033333333	0.033333333	0.333333333	0.033333333	0.033333333	0	0.066666667	0	0	0.1	0.066666667	0.033333333	0	0.066666667	0.166666667	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.051282051	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.051282051	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0.076923077	0.025641026	0	0.025641026	0.025641026	0	0	0.153846154	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0.076923077	0.051282051	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0.076923077					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7901	" ;Larson, Brendon; "	Ecological metaphors: Their cultural resonance and what we can do about it	 Ecologists commonly use metaphors to develop their ideas and to communicate them to the public. Unfortunately by their very nature metaphors may be interpreted in different ways by different constituencies and this may lead to misunderstanding of ecological concepts. For example a recent paper in Science reported on the prevalent use of the term natural enemies in recent scientific literature. Natural enemies and related terms such as exotic and invasive resonate with foreign policy so it is perhaps unsurprising that some individuals claim that invasive species policy is xenophobic. As another example consider the challenges that have arisen with the attempt to convince people that disturbance is an important and beneficial ecological process. Our NCEAS working group consisting of ecologists metaphor researchers philosophers and science communication scholars will assess whether there is anything we can do to ameliorate the misinterpretation and misapplication of ecological metaphors. Can we better control which metaphors are used? Is there any way to reduce misinterpretation of established metaphors? Practically we will develop suggestions for wise metaphor use among ecologists. 	2004	2004339:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	53	3	0.153846154	0.025641026	0.282051282	0.076923077	0.025641026	0.025641026	0	0.051282051	0	0.051282051	0.025641026	0.051282051	0.025641026	0.051282051	0.102564103	0.051282051	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0.044776119	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0.104477612	0.014925373	0	0.044776119	0.014925373	0	0	0.044776119	0	0.089552239	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.104477612	0	0	0.059701493	0	0	0.149253731	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7981	" ;Schimel, Joshua; "	 Can we now determine if when and how microbial community composition impacts ecosystem processes? Will that understanding yield critical new information about ecosystem function and response to change? 	 Linking populations and process dynamics has been a major thrust in ecology for the last decade or more. This issue has been a concern in microbial ecology but linking microbial community dynamics with ecosystem scale processes has been a major challenge. There remains debate as to whether any such linkages really exist though there are theories about which processes should be sensitive to community composition and there have been a number of individual studies that support these theories. There has not however been any broad and effective synthesis to test theories or critically assess how best to establish microbe ecosystem linkages. We propose a working group that will identify the most successful current approaches for establishing linkages work with available data sets and existing ecosystem models to determine how to best incorporate appropriate microbial community dynamics into larger scale models and work with the models to evaluate the effects of incorporating microbial dynamics into them. 	2004	2005342:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0.071428571	0.142857143	0.392857143	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0.071428571	0.071428571	0.035714286	0.12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.18	0.02	0	0.26	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0.06	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.02	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.14	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		8060	" ;Farber, Stephen; Costanza, Robert; "	 Understanding valuing and managing dynamic ecosystem services under stress: Synthesizing across the LTER Network 	 This project utilizes the LTER site network to develop understanding of the biogeophysical dynamics in stressed ecosystems and the implications of those dynamics for the valuation and management of ecosystem services and underlying ecological support systems.

The delineation of biodiversity hotspots that protect as many species as possible with as little land as possible has been the dominant paradigm in conservation science. Recently however this paradigm has been challenged on two accounts. The first challenge is that the burgeoning human population will make it impossible to adequately secure biodiversity in   protected areas   and that instead we must turn to working landscapes with substantial human use as places of biodiversity value. Second with so much of the world impoverished there is a need for land management that first and foremost ensures that basic natural services (or   ecosystem services  ) are provided to people. We intend to explore the spatial congruence between ecosystem services and biodiversity at multiple spatial scales and in so doing ask to what extent the provision of ecosystem services and biodiversity protection can be aligned and what are the tradeoffs where they are not aligned?This will be much more than a simple mapping exercise because it will be important to extend methods of ecosystem valuation to services and levels of detail that have been lacking thus far in the literature. Most existing maps of ecosystem services simply categorize each land area as a habitat type and then assign to that habitat type some   generalized dollar value  . In contrast we seek to create a spatially explicit accounting of biodiversity targets and ecosystems services along with a consideration of who benefits from the services and who might be expected to pay for them and how. Our purpose is not to replace the goal of biodiversity protection with the goal of ecosystem service protection. Rather we seek to understand if and how the two goals might both be met as well as how to minimize tradeoffs between the two goals where biodiversity and services are not strongly correlated. In addition to doing the spatial analyses of services and biodiversity we will explore financial mechanisms that might help pay for the services.Our working group will start with a mapping and valuation exercise entailing the Upper Yangtze River in China because of the many critical resource decisions this biodiversity rich region is currently facing. We will then extend our analyses to other systems as well as different spatial scales. Our working group will be fluid with membership varying depending on the systems and analyses under discussion; however the two hallmarks of this effort are its mix of on the ground conservation experience from international conservation NGOs and academic scholars including economists ecologists and conservation planners. 	2005	2008361:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	3	0	0	0.3	0.1	0	0	0.1	0.2	0.1	0	0	0	0.1	0	0.1	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0.153846154	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0.076923077	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		8940	" ;Baron, Nancy; "	COMPASS (formally SeaWeb)	 Nancy Baron a zoologist and science writer is the Science Outreach Director for SeaWeb COMPASS.

But as yet there is no scientific consensus on (1) the basic elements or processes involved in ecosystem based management; (2) the scientific understanding of coastal marine systems that it will require; or (3) how best to integrate that scientific understanding into decision making processes. The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has developed a strategic vision to fill this urgent need a carefully designed science program to help create and ensure the use of the knowledge tools and skills needed for EBM of sustainable coastal marine systems. In June 2004 the Packard Foundation awarded  DoLlQuAnT 2 060 292 to the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara for a three year program of activities involving the analysis and synthesis of existing data and development of new tools to address gaps in knowledge that are critical to successful implementation of ecosystem based management. The NCEAS activities will include support for working groups postdoctoral fellowships graduate student support and a distributed graduate seminar. In this program NCEAS will go beyond publishing academic papers to devise specific strategies to make the scientific knowledge developed through the project directly useful for practitioners and policy makers. Previous attempts to implement ecosystem based management have been hindered by the failure to effectively incorporate scientific understanding into the decision making process and by neglecting to include the stakeholders whose support will be essential to action. We expect that this set of NCEAS activities will lead to the development of a coherent body of knowledge that will change the conceptual foundations for managing coastal marine ecosystems and help develop the necessary capacity among individuals and institutions to catalyze this sea change. Both goals and approaches for EBM vary depending on geographic location social values institutional settings economic constraints etc. Nonetheless it is clear that EBM entails some level of understanding of the scale complexity and dynamic nature of both ecological and human systems. 	2003	201136:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0.170731707	0.073170732	0.658536585	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.113207547	0	0	0.169811321	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.037735849	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0.075471698	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0.169811321	0	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.037735849	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2058	" ;Farber, Stephen; Costanza, Robert; "	 Value of the worlds ecosystem services and natural capital: Toward a dynamic integrated approach 	 Our first workshop on this topic at NCEAS in June of 1996 was very successful at synthesizing the large (but scattered) existing information about the value of ecosystem services and natural capital and presenting it in a form useful for ecologists economists policy makers and the general public.

The goals of this working group are to utilize the results and momentum of the first workshop to: Reassess and update the results of the first workshop Carry the process further toward the goal of developing and using integrated models for the assessment of the value of ecosystem services. 	1998	2000374:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	3	0.018867925	0.132075472	0.547169811	0	0	0.018867925	0.056603774	0.037735849	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0.132075472	0	0.018867925	0	0.05	0.016666667	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0.2	0	0.016666667	0	0.016666667	0.033333333	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0.033333333	0	0.05	0.016666667	0	0	0	0	0.05	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0.016666667	0.016666667	0	0	0.016666667	0	0.016666667	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.066666667	0	0.083333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0.016666667	0	0	0.016666667	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9380	" ;Sagarin, Raphael; "	Ecological and evolutionary models for homeland security strategy	 Biological organisms have developed a remarkable number of strategies to mitigate conflict with a broad range of adversaries in their environment. The diversity and success of these strategies as illustrated by the millions of extant species on the Earth today suggests that biological evolution may be a field rich with lessons for guiding societal conflict resolution and security strategy. The working group will bring leading security policy analysts together with evolutionary biologists anthropologists and ecologists to draw on their expertise and identify evolutionary strategies that are applicable to security challenges faced by people institutions and nations in the 21st century. These biological analogies will be developed into models of decision making and behavior to explore alternative hypotheses related to strategies for security planning. The combination of biological and policy oriented perspectives will allow both a rich theoretical discussion and a realistic assessment of the barriers to practical applications of theory. 	2005	2005375:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	71	3	0	0.057142857	0.471428571	0.028571429	0.057142857	0	0.2	0.014285714	0	0.014285714	0.071428571	0.042857143	0	0.028571429	0.014285714	0	0	0.029411765	0.029411765	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.073529412	0	0	0.102941176	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.044117647	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.073529412	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0.191176471	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9381	" ;Williams, Neal; Kremen, Claire; "	Restoring an ecosystem service to degraded landscapes: Native bees and crop pollination	 Ecosystem services are critical to human survival; managing ecosystems for services could also provide important benefits for biodiversity. Unfortunately we seldom understand the ecology of these services well enough to manage them. Pollination services are necessary for 15 30 PeRcEnT of our food supply and are comparatively well understood relative to other ecosystem services. We propose to synthesize data on bee populations pollinator communities and pollination services across agro natural landscapes in order to: (1) develop models of the persistence of populations communities and pollination function at the landscape scale; (2) design an experiment to restore and monitor pollination function in agro natural landscapes replicated across sites landscapes and regions; and (3) extend this example to create a general conceptual framework for analyzing and managing ecosystem services. This work will improve our ability to manage agricultural lands which occupy 38 PeRcEnT of terrestrial area with benefits for food security human health and biodiversity. 	2005	2010405:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	19	3	0.181818182	0.03030303	0.303030303	0	0	0.090909091	0	0.060606061	0.060606061	0.060606061	0.03030303	0.03030303	0	0.03030303	0.060606061	0.060606061	0.03125	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0.03125	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.296875	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.046875	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0.125	0.046875	0	0	0	0	0.140625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10584	" ;Koricheva, Julia; Gurevitch, Jessica; "	 Meta analysis in ecology: Lessons challenges and future 	 Meta analysis represents a set of statistical methods for quantitative research synthesis developed in medicine and social sciences in late 1970s and introduced to ecology in early 1990s. It provides a more objective and informative alternative to narrative reviews and   vote counting   approaches traditionally used for research synthesis in ecology. Despite its great potential in addressing both basic and applied research questions the progress in meta analytic applications in ecology is still hindered by the limited availability of meta analytic training for ecology students limited palette of meta analytic techniques and tools available in ecology compared to that available in medicine and social sciences and the need to adjust these techniques to account for the structure of ecological data and the nature of ecological questions. The aims of our working group are to facilitate and to promote the thoughtful and critical use of meta analysis for research synthesis in ecology and to improve the power and rigour of ecological meta analysis. These aims will be achieved by writing a handbook of meta analysis for ecologists by updating existing statistical software for ecological meta analysis by creating an online forum on ecological meta analysis containing bibliography and teaching aids by taking advantage of recent methodological developments in quantitative research synthesis in medicine and social sciences and by adjusting standard meta analytical procedures to address specific ecological issues and problems. 	2006	2008409:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	15	3	0.098039216	0.098039216	0.509803922	0.039215686	0	0.058823529	0.058823529	0.039215686	0	0.019607843	0.019607843	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.039215686	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.075471698	0	0	0.075471698	0	0	0.188679245	0	0	0	0.339622642	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.113207547	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10681	" ;Rosenberg, Andrew; Micheli, Fiorenza; "	A synthetic approach to the science of ecosystem based management of coastal marine ecosystems 	 We will develop a modeling and data integration framework for EBM and apply that framework to a case study from coastal California.

In recent years numerous studies aimed at examining the importance of agroecosystems to the conservation of biodiversity have been published. These studies focus on identifying the types of agricultural landscapes and landscape components that support the greatest levels of biodiversity. The most commonly discussed goal associated with these studies is to determine whether and how agricultural landscapes can be managed to support high levels of biodiversity while continuing to allow for profitable agriculture. Less attention has been given to the role that agrobiodiversity plays in providing ecosystem services or how agrobiodiversity can be managed to increase both on and off farm services. Our DGS takes advantage of growing knowledge of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning to identify key relationships between agrobiodiversity and ecosystem services. We anticipate that our efforts will greatly advance understanding of how changes in species composition and overall diversity may enhance or diminish key ecosystem services. Specifically we aim to identify key mechanisms that drive agrobiodiversity and ecosystem service relationships; identify whether and how differing spatial arrangement and levels of connectivity between agricultural and natural landscape components impact the provision of services; and propose management options that maximize both conservation and positive relationship between agrobiodiveristy and ecosystem services. 	2006	2009448:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0	0.115384615	0.346153846	0	0.115384615	0	0.153846154	0	0.153846154	0	0	0	0	0	0.038461538	0.076923077	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0.03030303	0.151515152	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0.03030303	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0.060606061	0.03030303	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12021	" ;Aukema, Juliann; "	Economic and ecological implications of non native forest pests and pathogens 	 My research interests lie in spatial patterns processes and mechanisms underlying species interactions and distributions and in applied conservation.

The Sustainable Fisheries Group (SFG) operates on the principle that successful fisheries require institutions that provide economic incentives to fishermen. These incentives lead to behavior consistent with marine conservation. Our strategy is to use innovative financial tools to implement solutions that will align economic and conservation incentives. Recognizing the need to address underlying economic issues facing fishermen and their industry the SFG will synthesize knowledge and intellectual capital to ensure that fisheries prosper enhance communities of coastal residents and provide local nutritious seafood to consumers. As one mechanism toward that end NCEAS will host several Working Groups seeking to assess financial ecological and socioeconomic benefits and risks associated with different potential mechanisms of fisheries reform. The SFG is a partnership between the University of California at Santa Barbara (including NCEAS) and Environmental Defense a nongovernmental organization that is a national leader in marine and fishery conservation.

Ecology is undergoing a rapid transformation a major component of which is the increasingly interdisciplinary scope of ecological research. Among the most salient attempts to bridge disciplines are occurring between ecology and the social sciences. Driven by the complexity of social ecological interactions and pressing environmental concerns attempts to merge these disciplines have become institutionalized in research centers funding initiatives scholarly journals and conferences. Because change has been rapid little is known about the character of these efforts and their impact on science. These issues will be explored through a comparative multi method investigation of the practice and outcomes of synthetic social ecological research. Expected outcomes include: 1) enhancing understanding of the most effective means by which to catalyze disciplinary synthesis 2) advancing knowledge about the social and technical processes characteristic of synthetic collaborations 3) increasing insight regarding the effect of synthetic participation on researchers careers and 4) providing information on disciplinary synthesis as an agent of scientific change. 	2008	2011506:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	3	0.147058824	0	0.558823529	0.117647059	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0.088235294	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.205882353	0	0.264705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.117647059	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0.117647059	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12194	" ;Fleishman, Erica; "	Valuation of marine ecosystem services	 NCEAS and the California Ocean Protection Council are collaborating to examine existing methods of market and non market valuation of marine ecosystem services.

Megafires are currently overwhelming human control despite huge budgets and mature fire fighting technologies. There is mounting evidence that beyond immediate destruction of life and property landscape fires have long term effects on global carbon stocks biodiversity climate world economies and human health. Despite fires pervasive influence in many disciplines there is no uniting theory or paradigm concerning the role of biomass burning in Earth science. Moreover fire has not been satisfactorily considered by global change policy and ecosystem management. We therefore propose a thought experiment addressing (i) whether fire would evolve where carbon based life is resent (ii) how it would evolve and (iii) how humans their cultures and fire may have coevolved. We will combine knowledge about biomass burning across fields to develop an integrative paradigm of pyrogeography that addresses these fundamental questions. This synthetic exercise will inform and coordinate participants research to derive global products that highlight how and where shifting fire regimes will have consequences for human health property and ecosystem services including global terrestrial carbon stocks. Our outputs will be a succinct review paper an edited volume and a concise book that collectively will: (i) provide a conceptual framework to account for the variation of fire types (intensity frequency and extent) in space time and amongst cultures (ii) set out working hypotheses that will guide future work and (iii) identify major omissions of fires important role in Earth science and management. These outputs are a prerequisite for adaptation to the apparent recent intensification of fireclimate vegetation feedbacks which have been exacerbated by climate change rapid land cover transformation and exotic species introductions that challenge the evolutionary integrity of entire biomes. 	2010	2012521:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	38	3	0.166666667	0	0.333333333	0	0	0.166666667	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.117647059	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.176470588	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0.117647059	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.176470588	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12254	" ;Fagan, William; "	Dendritic landscapes: Exploring connectivity and biodiversity in an alternative geometry	 As an NCEAS Sabbatical Fellow I propose to explore the implications of dendritic (branching) geometries such as those found in river networks and elsewhere in nature for ecological complexity through the development of theoretical models. 	2008	2009522:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	3	0.114285714	0.028571429	0.314285714	0.185714286	0.042857143	0.057142857	0.1	0.014285714	0.028571429	0.014285714	0.028571429	0	0.014285714	0	0	0.057142857	0	0.00990099	0	0	0	0	0	0.108910891	0	0	0.04950495	0	0	0	0.089108911	0	0.00990099	0.069306931	0.01980198	0.01980198	0	0.00990099	0	0	0.069306931	0.00990099	0	0	0.01980198	0	0	0.00990099	0	0	0.00990099	0	0	0	0	0.02970297	0.099009901	0	0	0.00990099	0.00990099	0	0.00990099	0	0	0.00990099	0	0	0	0.00990099	0.04950495	0	0.03960396	0	0	0	0.03960396	0	0	0.02970297	0	0	0.02970297	0	0	0	0.02970297	0.00990099	0	0	0	0	0.01980198	0	0	0	0.02970297	0.00990099	0.01980198	0.00990099	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12259	" ;van der Leeuw, Sander; Costanza, Robert; Graumlich, Lisa; "	Integrated history and future of people on Earth: Building a community data base and testing the resilience sustainability hypothesis across scales	 Understanding the reasons for the emergence sustainability decline or collapse of human societies is a key prerequisite for creating a sustainable and desirable future.

The proposed working group will assemble integrated environmental and human historical data at the global scale for comparative analysis and for a few key case study areas for dynamic analysis in order to help build this understanding. We will develop criteria for integrating and analyzing disparate data across scales and disciplines.

A key component of this activity will be developing better ways to integrate and visualize data from the broad range of relevant sources  from historical narratives to ice cores) and with a broad range of spatial and temporal resolution and quality. In assembling the integrated data base the working group will also develop meta variables and indices that can serve as proxies for environmental predictability and system resilience. We can then test the ability of various proxies of system resilience to explain sustainability or breakdown of social structures relative to alternative hypotheses.

Megafires are currently overwhelming human control despite huge budgets and mature fire fighting technologies. There is mounting evidence that beyond immediate destruction of life and property landscape fires have long term effects on global carbon stocks biodiversity climate world economies and human health. Despite fires pervasive influence in many disciplines there is no uniting theory or paradigm concerning the role of biomass burning in Earth science. Moreover fire has not been satisfactorily considered by global change policy and ecosystem management. We therefore propose a thought experiment addressing (i) whether fire would evolve where carbon based life is present (ii) how it would evolve and (iii) how humans their cultures and fire may have coevolved. We will combine knowledge about biomass burning across fields to develop an integrative paradigm of pyrogeography that addresses these fundamental questions. In a period of intensifying fire activity our synthesis will provide crucial information that aids human adaptation. 	2008	2008549:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	60	3	0.032258065	0.032258065	0.403225806	0.048387097	0.096774194	0.016129032	0.016129032	0.032258065	0.032258065	0.032258065	0.016129032	0.032258065	0.016129032	0	0.177419355	0.016129032	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.034090909	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.090909091	0	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.056818182	0.068181818	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.034090909	0	0.318181818	0	0	0.045454545	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12354	" ;Sabo, John; "	 Dams river networks and the distribution of native and non native freshwater fauna in the United States  	 Dams are ubiquitous in riverscapes and implicated in biotic homogenization of river ecosystems. Biotic homogenization (BH) is defined as a reduction in biogeographic variation in species composition and caused by extinction of native fauna and invasion of non indigenous species. The goal of my proposed Sabbatical Fellow research is to define a quantitative approach to conservation biogeography of rivers rooted in drainage network theory. I will use seven georeferenced databases to quantify the effects of river network structure the quantity and size of dams and nature of dam placement within the context of river networks on flow related changes in river biota across the US. In contrast to previous work on this topic I will tackle this question using a structural equation modeling approach that accounts for spatially autocorrelated errors in these datasets while simultaneously modeling complex cause effect relationships. This will allow me to quantify the cumulative (serial) effects of multiple dams in drainage networks and the interactive effects of dam and network properties on BH. This work should provide general rules of thumb about where in watersheds dam removal and experimental release strategies would work best. 	2009	2010558:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	19	3	0	0.1	0.366666667	0.016666667	0.05	0.116666667	0	0.016666667	0.033333333	0.066666667	0.016666667	0.033333333	0.05	0.1	0.016666667	0.016666667	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0.094117647	0	0.011764706	0.023529412	0.011764706	0	0.023529412	0.011764706	0.2	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0.023529412	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.023529412	0.023529412	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0.070588235	0.035294118	0	0.011764706	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.129411765	0.023529412	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047058824	0.035294118	0	0.011764706	0.023529412	0.035294118	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0.011764706					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12374	" ;Konrad, Christopher; Olden, Julian; "	Evaluating responses of freshwater ecosystems to experimental water management	 The availability of fresh water to meet the demands of a growing human population and simultaneously ensure ecosystem integrity has emerged as one of the worlds primary resource issues (Postel and Richter 2003; Alcamo . 2008). Water management for people and ecosystems remains an open scientific question (Acreman and Dunbar 2004 Arthington .2006) that is being answered with experimental approaches to releasing water from dams and other control structures for ecological benefits in rivers floodplains and estuaries. Flow experiments present an unrivaled opportunity to evaluate large scale experimental approaches in ecosystem management because of shared scientific approaches. We propose bringing scientists together in a working group to integrate the site specific results of large scale flow experiments and synthesize general lessons to guide future large scale experiments and ecosystem management in other places. We will: 1) test the limits of extrapolation across scales and integration across sites in drawing general conclusions about ecological responses to flow experiments; 2) identify criteria for attributing immediate direct responses and long term changes in the status of populations communities and ecosystems to experimental manipulation; and 3) develop innovative approaches that facilitate the ransfer of knowledge from large scale experiments to broader applications. 	2009	201056:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	3	0.033333333	0.266666667	0.333333333	0	0.033333333	0.033333333	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0.033333333	0	0.166666667	0.066666667	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0.066666667	0	0.033333333	0.066666667	0	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0.033333333	0	0	0.033333333	0	0.1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.133333333	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2091	" ;Michener, William; Haeuber, Richard; "	Interdisciplinary synthesis of recent natural and managed floods	 Science policy and resource management knowledge gaps as they relate to flooding will be addressed by three NCEAS working groups.

Such advances however are hindered by data heterogeneity which impedes the ability of researchers to discover interpret and integrate relevant data that have been collected by others. A number of earth science disciplines however are recognizing the interoperability benefits of describing data at the level of observation and measurement rather than at the level of the data set. The investigators propose the Scientific Observations Network (SONet) to initiate a multi disciplinary community driven effort to define and develop the necessary specifications and technologies to facilitate semantic interpretation and integration of observational data across earth science domains. The technological approaches will derive from recent advances in knowledge representation that have demonstrated great utility in enhancing scientific communication and data interoperability within the genomics community. This effort will constitute a community of experts consisting of environmental science researchers computer scientists and information managers to develop open source standards based approaches to the semantic modeling of observational data. Working groups of experts will also engage in extending this core data model to include a broad range of specific measurements collected by the representative set of disciplines and a series of demonstration projects will illustrate the capabilities of the approaches to confederate data for reuse in broader and unanticipated contexts. 	2009	NaN573:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	60	3	0	0.029850746	0.462686567	0	0	0.253731343	0	0	0	0.074626866	0.029850746	0	0.044776119	0.074626866	0	0.029850746	0.047619048	0	0.011904762	0	0.011904762	0	0	0.130952381	0.047619048	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0.05952381	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0.011904762	0.011904762	0	0	0.011904762	0.011904762	0	0	0.178571429	0	0.023809524	0.083333333	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0.047619048	0	0.119047619	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12444	" ;Schoups, Gerrit; Sabo, John; Bowling, Laura; "	Human impacts of water infrastructure on watershed ecosystems and the sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the coterminous US	 The goal of the proposed working group is twofold: 1) to measure the ecological footprint of freshwater infrastructure in the US  dams irrigated agriculture growing urban centers) and 2) to identify sustainable solutions to potential water shortages given climate change and rapid growth of major US urban areas.

During our meetings scientists and policymakers will synthesize datasets of urban demographic socio economic and biophysical change affecting the supply and demand of these two key ecosystem services.

Ecosystem services are the provision of things and experiences by ecosystems for people. The ecologists and economists working in this field have primarily focused on measuring mapping and valuing provisioning and regulating services; cultural services are always mentioned but the integrated incorporation of such services into decision making remains decades behind the more tangible services. We propose to change this by jump starting the integration of cultural services into ecosystem service decision making tools. This working group will bring together an interdisciplinary group of ecologists anthropologists political scientists philosophers sociologists and practitioners to tackle the thorny question How do changes in ecosystems affect changes in cultural values in different scenarios for use of coastal and marine regions? We will review the available data linking such ecosystem change to changes in cultural values paying particular attention to interactions between services and to non linearities. Our project will provide a framework for employing quantitative andwhere necessaryqualitative methods to explicitly consider such values in marine and coastal planning. 	2009	2011587:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	3	0.029411765	0.073529412	0.544117647	0.147058824	0	0.029411765	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.044117647	0.014705882	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0.111111111	0.152777778	0	0.069444444	0.041666667	0.013888889	0	0.027777778	0.013888889	0.013888889	0.013888889	0.027777778	0	0	0.125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0.013888889	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0.013888889					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12470	" ;Crowder, Larry; McLeod, Karen; Rosenberg, Andrew; Fogarty, Michael; "	A framework to assess ecosystem health in support of ecosystem based management of coastal marine systems 	 Maintaining healthy productive marine ecosystems is a recurrent theme in policy recommendations management deliberations and public sentiment. While healthy oceans are a broadly shared goal distinct vital signs to gauge the state of oceans have not been widely implemented yet are essential for effective policy making. This working group will reduce hundreds of candidate indicators to a manageable set that will serve as critical monitoring and planning tools for effective marine ecosystem based management. Specifically we will bring together leading scholars and practitioners from ecology fisheries oceanography economics and applied social sciences to develop ecosystem health metrics for the Arctic continental shelves coral reefs estuaries and coastal upwelling regions. We will address three overarching questions: (1) What does ecosystem health mean and how can we measure it? (2) How can we measure the degree to which human well being is sustained by marine systems? (3) How transferable are such metrics across different systems? The indicators developed through this initiative will serve as concrete concepts to help catalyze political will pave the way for policy making at all levels of government provide critical tools to communicate the state of marine systems to the public and facilitate much needed integration across the social and natural sciences. 	2010	2012597:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	21	3	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12481	" ;Bever, James; "		The Science Advisory Board (SAB) is comprised of 18 members and one chair from disciplines supported by NCEAS.

At the same time the need for natural history information is in greater demand than ever before. Declines in natural history may have far reaching consequences potentially reducing progress across the natural sciences changing how we view and understand the world and limiting the tools we have to plan for the future and yet there is a paucity of data driven evaluations exploring changes in natural history in research education and in society. This raises an important question: is Natural History truly declining or simply changing? Have we lost natural history from undergraduate education or has it moved from taxon to topic focused courses? In this sabbatical I propose to synthesize contemporary trends in natural history and explore their consequences. During my sabbatical I will manage 4 workshops (funded externally) that will assist in re imaging the role of natural history in society research and education and I will draw together a large array of data on the practice of natural history from graduate and undergraduate field time in US institutions to field guide book sales and trends in nature center enrolment and curricula. All of this data will become part of the NCEAS database. In addition I will integrate this work with ongoing ecoinformatics initiatives ongoing at NCEAS (DataONE). This effort and this proposal is the product of a session I organized at the Ecological Society of America annual meeting this year focused on the past and future of natural history. This was the most heavily attended session of the meeting with over 400 ecologists present and multiple opportunities to synthesize this information (two book requests two journal requests and a workshop proposal to NSF) came directly from that session at ESA. The workshop proposal has now been funded and I plan to integrate that work with ongoing initiatives at NCEAS. 	2010	2011619:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	3	0.038461538	0.019230769	0.653846154	0.019230769	0.019230769	0.019230769	0	0.019230769	0	0	0.019230769	0	0.019230769	0.076923077	0.019230769	0.076923077	0.058823529	0.029411765	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.294117647	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.176470588	0	0.029411765	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12584	" ;Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Polasky, Stephen; "	Developing curricula and model systems for sustainability science	 Sustaining the systems that support life while meeting human needs represents one of the greatest challenges that we face in the 21st century.

The rapid urbanization of the world has profound effects on global biodiversity and urbanization has been counted among the processes contributing to the homogenization of the worlds biota. However there are few generalities of the patterns and drivers of urban biota and even fewer global comparative studies. A comparative approach of urban biota is needed to produce comparable methodologies to understand preserve and monitor biodiversity in cities. We propose an NCEAS working group involving researchers from cities worldwide to develop synthesis of urban ecology. We ask the overarching question: What makes an urban biota urban? and with that Are the patterns of urban biota and the processes that shape them the same across the worlds cities? We have identified several factors that may serve as filters determining species distributions. We propose a hierarchical series of filters: 1) regional scale biogeographic context 2) metropolitan scale urban intensification and 3) local scale socio economic cultural factors. We will use plants and birds as independent datasets for addressing these broad questions. There is a newly matured wealth of existing urban bird and plant datasets for cities of different sizes ages and cultural and development patterns such as Baltimore Berlin Jalisco New York City Phoenix Potchefstroom and Stockholm among others. We propose to bring datasets together using commonly available data  land cover layers national censuses life history databases) to synthesize the urban biota. Outcomes from these proposed extensive comparative analyses will not only help to push forward the frontiers of transdisciplinarity in ecology but will also provide useful information for planners and managers. 	2011	2012629:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	27	3	0	0	0.333333333	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12608	" ;Ricketts, Taylor; "		The Science Advisory Board (SAB) is comprised of 18 members and one chair from disciplines supported by NCEAS.

Humans depend on ecological systems for a variety of services. These services are threatened by anthropogenic perturbations that may cause sudden discontinuous changes in ecosystem state. Consequently management and regulatory agencies have invested a great deal of effort in developing early warning indicators for these discontinuous changes. However the theoretical and empirical basis for such indicators is not well developed. I propose to use simulation modeling and literature analysis to test the hypothesis that reliable early warning indicators of discontinuous change do not exist. If affirmed this hypothesis suggests that the effects of increasing human impacts on ecosystems may not be reliably anticipated. If rejected this hypothesis suggests that a sound basis for environmental indicators can be developed. Regardless of the outcome this research will expand our understanding of ecosystem response to anthropogenic perturbations. 	1996	1998653:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	3	0.063492063	0.063492063	0.158730159	0.015873016	0	0.079365079	0.142857143	0.047619048	0.079365079	0.031746032	0.031746032	0.031746032	0	0.079365079	0.095238095	0.079365079	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.059701493	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.044776119	0	0	0	0.044776119	0	0	0	0.029850746	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.059701493	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0.014925373	0	0	0.029850746	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0.164179104	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0.134328358	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.074626866	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.089552239	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12658	" ;Hampton, Stephanie; Marsh, David; "	 Toads roads and nodes: Collaborative course based research on the landscape ecology of amphibian populations 	 We propose to link networks of undergraduate ecology and conservation biology courses to study the factors that promote the persistence of amphibian populations at landscape and regional scales.

Representatives from each class will then bring their data to a meeting at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) to compile and analyze them at the national scale. In the first year of the project classes will examine the effects of current landscape features on amphibian distributions. In the second year classes will use older satellite imagery to discern the residual effects of past land use on amphibians and determine the lag time over which forest loss and road construction affect amphibians. In each project year students will engage with a complete piece of scientific research from hypothesis to conclusion and each years project should result in a research publication.

There is a growing demand for standardization of assessment tools (measures metrics and standards) that can be applied in a consistent manner across ecoregions and by practitioners from agencies with differing programmatic mandates. This task will require agreement across ecologists economists social scientists and practitioners from academia state and federal agencies nonprofits and the private sector. We propose an NCEAS working group to focus on the ecological and biodiversity characteristics related to the production of ecosystem services especially the development of robust consistent methods and metrics for measuring the quantity and relative ecological value of these services in a multi criteria decision framework.

Already the proportion of the worlds GDP annually exposed to tropical cyclones has increased from 3.6 PeRcEnT in the 1970s to 4.3 PeRcEnT in the first decade of the 2000s (UNISDR 2011). In 2011 insured losses from natural disasters (especially coastal and riverine hazards) reached an all time high and impacts will continue to worsen with continued climate change. Looking globally at socio economic vulnerability to all natural hazards  earthquakes fires storms) the top 15 most at risk nations are all coastal tropical and developing nations (World Risk Report 2012). Erosion inundation and extreme weather events affect hundreds of millions of vulnerable people important infrastructure tourism and trade with significant losses to national economies and major impacts on human suffering. Ecosystem degradation raises these risks by further exposing communities and assets to more waves winds and water. Coastal and marine habitats particularly coral reefs and wetlands are at the front line of many of these changes and are increasingly lost and degraded. Global losses of coastal habitats are as high as 85 PeRcEnT for oyster reefs; 30 50 PeRcEnT for wetlands; and approximately 20 PeRcEnT for coral reefs. Often the loss of these habitats is greatest around population centers. That is where the most people could benefit from these ecosystems is often where their impacts and loss have been the greatest. Billions of dollars are moving to reduce risks from disasters and climate change creating both threats and opportunities for natural systems. Total Fast Start Finance commitments under the UNFCCC (through 2012) include roughly  DoLlQuAnT 3 billion for climate adaptation assistance. In the US FEMA spends  DoLlQuAnT 500 million year to reduce flooding hazards. Middle income countries such as Colombia Brazil and China are making multibillion dollar investments to address risks of flooding and other disasters exacerbated by climate change. Cities are also mobilizing quickly: New York for example have robust climate adaptation plans and is working to address climate impacts with other mega cities via the C40 effort. Most these funds are destined for the creation of grey infrastructure such as seawalls which will further degrade coastal ecosystems and may not be cost effective for risk reduction when compared to more natural and hybrid alternatives. Because of the wave of global science following Katrina and the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami decision makers  post Sandy) recognize that coastal habitats have some role to play in risk reduction. Those decision makers now are rightly asking (i) How cost effective are natural ecosystems for coastal defense? (ii) Where and how should we restore these natural defenses? (iii) How do we create incentives to reduce risks by conserving coastal habitats? We will constitute a SNAP Working Group composed of leaders from coastal engineering conservation ecology aid and development to address these problems head on. We will (a) Provide evidence on when where and how investments in natural defenses are cost effective; (b) Develop practical guidance and tools for decision makers and practitioners to implement solutions; (c) Identify policy and financial incentives that lead to reduced risks for people and nature. To enhance the pathways to impact and opportunities for practical implementation we will also convene a Resource User Group to test and provide feedback about the research insights and tools developed by the SNAP Working Group. We will also establish a SNAP Rapid Recovery team to be well prepared for the predictable likelihood that a tropical cyclone will hit a core project site in September October 2015. After every disaster there is a scramble to identify new development and restoration policies and practices that help in the recovery of the infrastructure and environment. These restoration and recovery decisions get made very quickly (often in the first 3 16 weeks post storm) and there is an urgent demand for evidence based guidance in the development of sensible policies and practices. Our programs and leaders  Tercek) have been asked to help write and direct these policies and practices on very tight timelines. Decades of intractable development policies can be turned on their head and billions of dollars are unleashed post event much of which could be better directed for risk reduction and conservation.

These rivers and floodplains are critical to livelihoods providing among other things important sources of high protein food (fish caimans and turtles) employment in a major fisheries industry a vast inland transportation network and drinking water for rural populations and growing cities. Large scale infrastructure development including hydroelectric dams roads and pipelines is already impacting the Western Amazon and more installations are planned. Aquatic ecosystems and the fisheries associated with them will increasingly be impacted by changes in the hydrological cycle caused by dam projects by upland and floodplain deforestation associated with land conversion to farming and ranching and by climate change. Together these threats could jeopardize the diversity and productivity of aquatic systems and the livelihoods of the rural and urban people who depend on them. The vast size of the Amazon Basin and the interlocking relationships among the ecological systems and processes involved such as between terra firme and flooded forests hydrological cycles and fish migrations dams and water quality and quantity and between climate drivers and regional weather patterns strongly suggest that to be effective conservation actions must be informed by scientific analysis and synthesis of information at large enough scales as to be capable of capturing these ecological complexities. The rapid expansion of energy infrastructure and urbanization in the Amazon coupled with greater frequency of extreme hydrological events means that integrated river basin management has become critical to inform a balanced conservation and development strategy. A large scale management framework has begun to gain traction in the political arena such as in the large department of Loreto Peru where conservation planning and fisheries management measures related to infrastructure projects in the Andes and Amazonian lowlands are being put in place by local governments. By engaging with policy makers from the region from the inception of this working group and by including scientific experts who are engaged in these incipient management efforts in the region this SNAP effort will build upon and help strengthen these emerging frameworks. Also some donors have reoriented their conservation strategies to include infrastructure impacts and freshwater management issues  Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation). WCS partners with both Foundations on related projects for fisheries management protected area management and other conservation goals in the western Amazon and has had a series of conversations with Foundation representatives to ensure complementarity among those efforts and the SNAP working group. This complementarity will be facilitated by the participation of representatives from both Foundations in the western Amazon working group. The proposed SNAP working group will launch its first Amazonian project with two critical goals: first the working group will analyze and synthesize available data to generate a series of plausible future scenarios that reflect different land use patterns development and investment options resource management regimes and climate forecasts at an unprecedented spatial scale that captures the complexity and interconnectivity of Amazon aquatic and terrestrial ecology and biodiversity; and second by bringing government and donor stakeholders to the table to examine the tradeoffs associated with each scenario the group will distill from the synthesized and analyzed data key recommendations for conservation actions at levels of decision making appropriate to the scale and complexity of the Western Amazon. The final result will be a road map for integrated river basin management and planning that could achieve an acceptable balance among ecosystem health and connectivity food security and infrastructure needs in the western Amazon informed by science and translated into a language and format usable by decision makers. The working group will address the following critical questions: 1. Where are the highest conservation value areas (HCVA) for migratory fish? Fish are the most important source of food security for the Amazons millions of human residents and as such the most important natural resource about which people are most likely to care. Both medium distance (up to several hundred km annually) and long distance (basin wide) migratory fish play key roles in Amazonian aquatic ecosystem function and constitute 80 PeRcEnT or more of the fish harvest. This expert working group led by Michael Goulding will convene a small group of fisheries and limnological experts to evaluate available data on fish production and reproduction and produce a spatial analysis of priority areas for conservation of migratory fish. The expert group will evaluate a) the distribution of each species; b) the distribution of major habitats such as flooded forests lakes and floating meadows that are critical for fish growth; c) known spawning habitats for groups of migratory species; d) the distribution of nurseries habitats; e) the relative importance of existing protected areas and other managed areas to fisheries; and f) estimates of current levels of exploitation within commercial and subsistence fisheries. The identification of high conservation value areas for fish derived from these analyses can then lead to recommendations (see 5) for an action plan to manage migratory fish harvest and the flooded forests floating meadows lakes and river stretches necessary to maintain growth reproduction and recruitment.

Public concerns over potential impacts are high leading to interest by policymakers and regulators for science based recommendations. However current knowledge gaps limit implementation of sound policy to avoid and mitigate impacts to surface and ground water. We propose a SNAP working group that will synthesis data and regulations to: 1) project water demand based on development scenarios and identify watersheds with potential for water quantity conflicts and the restrictions required to avoid such conflicts; 2) evaluate spatial pattern of chemical use and identify risks and knowledge gaps; 3) simulate contamination events and proposed mitigation responses to quantify impacts on environment and people and identify policies needed to mitigate risk; and 4) communicate results and policy recommendations to stakeholders through meetings a policy white paper peer reviewed publications and web based products.

This problem is pervasive across the globe with examples from developed nations like Australia where human activities have caused a 20 50 PeRcEnT decline in coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef over the past two decades 2 to developing nations like India where over 40 PeRcEnT of mangroves have been converted to agriculture or urban development.3 These issues are particularly acute when peoples livelihoods dependupon the natural resources under threat such as fisheries which sustain some of the worlds poorest people.4 5 Our proposed project will focus on how land use changes and management interventions impact fisheries and livelihoods in regions of high dependence on coastal resources. In Melanesia for example increased demands for cash income and material goods coupled with growing populations and access to markets have led to increased pressure on coastal and marine resources. Rural communities must meet annual payments for school fees and government levies as well as support intermittent religious obligations and health care costs. As a consequence coastal residents are increasing the frequency and intensity of harvesting fish and commercially valuable invertebrates as a source of incomto meet these financial challenges.6 At the same time local land owners are increasing the area of land under commercial agriculture as well as becoming increasingly willing to grant leases for logging and mining which can negatively affect freshwater and coastal fisheries habitats through land based runoff.7 This problem that will be even more pronounced in places experiencing increasing rainfall (an thus increased runoff) from climate change. This commercialization of resources endangers the ability of people to meet their future food security needs from fisheries which are already under threat from subsistence fishing alone.8 Thus management plans for marine and terrestrial natural resources must consider how and where human activities impact fisheries and the livelihoods they support. Management and conservation of marine resources is almost always focused on reducing overfishing without regard to the influence terrestrial activities  farming logging) have on marine resources. Two possible reasons for this biased focus are: 1) asymmetry of information where more data are available on the impacts of overfishing than on land based activities; and 2) lack of integrated land sea models and planning approaches to support management decisions. The proposed project will address both of these information gaps through three aims. 	2014	NaN681:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	73	3	0.008474576	0.139830508	0.453389831	0.021186441	0.008474576	0.194915254	0	0.012711864	0.046610169	0.016949153	0.012711864	0.008474576	0.016949153	0	0.046610169	0.012711864	0	0.044776119	0.029850746	0.007462687	0	0	0	0.070895522	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01119403	0	0.007462687	0.003731343	0	0	0	0.126865672	0	0.003731343	0.01119403	0	0	0	0.03358209	0	0	0	0.003731343	0	0	0.007462687	0.007462687	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.003731343	0	0	0	0	0.007462687	0	0.041044776	0	0	0.01119403	0	0	0	0.003731343	0.037313433	0	0.074626866	0.03358209	0.003731343	0.089552239	0	0	0.093283582	0	0.01119403	0.007462687	0	0	0	0.145522388	0.003731343	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0	0.018656716	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12689	" ;Goldstein, Joshua; Tellman, Elizabeth; "	Prioritizing investments in green infrastructure to meet urban water security needs in Latin America	 Water stress is an increasing global problem with as much as 30 PeRcEnT of the worlds population facing water shortages on a regular basis. Water stress arises because of growing water withdrawals for both irrigation and drinking water. This is will be exacerbated in the future by both rising demands from the expanding and urbanizing human population and higher evapotranspiration rates driven by global warming. Water scarcity can directly impact human wellbeing by decreasing sanitation and food security and constraining economic growth in developing countries. Multilateral development banks and national governments historically have reduced water stress with large infrastructure projects such as dams reservoirs and wells. Water quality which will be further exacerbated by lower flows is generally addressed via expensive treatment plants. In addition to exacerbating existing water scarcity and quality concerns predicted climate change impacts on precipitation  in Latin America) may increase the frequency and intensity of storm events. Flood events in developing countries have long term economic impacts. Existing city flood control infrastructure may be overwhelmed and even destroyed by record river levels. However increasing river channelization to respond to increasing flows can increase costs for water treatment as natural floodplains that filter toxins are replaced with concrete walls. Climate change will require some cities to adapt to complex problems of water scarcity flooding and reduced water quality. This overwhelming and expensive challenge can in some cases be partially met with natural infrastructure and holistic watershed management reducing the need for costly built infrastructure. Furthermore investments in watershed protection and restoration can provide additional benefits for biodiversity conservation ecosystem services rural livelihoods and economic development. Water funds have created an innovative mechanism to mobilize and scale up investment in natural capital to meet cities growing water security needs. Starting with the pioneering program launched in Quito Ecuador in 2000 over 30 water funds are now in operation primarily in Latin America and expanding to the United States Africa Asia and Australia. Water funds represent a promising strategy to advance the use of nature as infrastructure to meet human needs. To date most investments in water funds and related natural infrastructure projects have arisen on an ad hoc basis since systematic analyses on how to maximize return on investment have not been available. To fill this gap our project has two overarching goals. First we will develop and demonstrate a decision oriented rapid assessment methodology to identify the most promising cities for water funds based on science  hydrology economics climatology) institutional analysis and investment potential.

Growing calls for this transition is evident on numerous fronts including efforts of the private sector to account for natural capital; government initiatives with the World Bank to account for and value ecosystem services as a complement to GDP; a growing body of academic work on measuring monitoring and valuing ecosystem services; and the creation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem services. This SNAP working group will organize a series of four workshops aimed at developing agriculture ecosystem and natural resource based indicators for planning and monitoring country scale progress on the Sustainable Development Goals. We propose to work closely with the government ministries of the Volta and Nile basin countries in the development of ecosystem and natural resource based indicators for the Sustainable Development Goals (Burkina Faso Ghana Ethiopia and Kenya). We will focus on indicators that are grounded in ecosystem sciences that include novel evaluation measures for natural capital and ecosystem services and that are formulated to be of practical relevance to policy makers faced with making difficult decisions on large scale development opportunities and their impact on livelihoods present and future. The working group meetings will alternate between focused dialogues with high level national stakeholders synthetic work on ecosystem and resilience based measures of relevance to decision makers and scenario analysis of key national scale development opportunities to test proposed indicators.

Current proposals to create development corridors in developing countries pose both risks and opportunities to smallholder farming and agricultural sustainability. These proposals have political support but have suffered from a lack of science and scenario analysis. The Southern Agricultural Growth Corridor of Tanzania SAGCOT corridors is one such place that could significantly alter the economics of all scales of farming and conservation in a large part of Tanzania changing patterns of market access and land use. There are risks: large scale monoculture could replace more diverse production systems displacing smallholders. But there is also an opportunity to bring science to bear showing how improved market access can enable the sustainable intensification of agriculture at scale through more sophisticated planning for the long term maintenance of environmental services along with including smallholders in value chains. This group will use a range of economic and modeling tools to establish costs and benefits in this corridor and analyze how they shift when impacts to ecosystem services are considered in a range of demand scenarios. This will help identify critical geographies within the corridors where economic potential exists but where problems with natural resources can be expected if intensification proceeds without a focus on environmental services. Landscape level planning techniques will be used to suggest different agricultural development configurations capable of informing decision making. The aim is to show what sustainable intensification could look like if planned at this formative stage in the evolution of these corridors.

Although the formation of such a market is the leading candidate for implementation of any international climate change agreement involving binding limits on carbon emissions from richer countries the components of the estimation described below would be helpful regardless of the form of carbon regulation adopted. An important part of this estimation is to explore how sensitive the result is to the approaches taken (in particular the ecological approach) in estimation and in the establishment of a carbon monitoring system.This type of supply function information is of great policy interest not only for the specific case of Costa Rica but also for other countries which may want to participate in such a market. This is especially true for those countries with forests ecologically similar to those of Costa Rica the exact definition of which will become clearer as a result of the sensitivity testing. The sensitivity testing will also indicate how best to simplify the workings of such a market which would increase the opportunities for small land owners to participate when it is in their interest.Finally producing such an estimate requires expertise from not only ecology but also economics and both of the two major components of this estimation can stand alone as disciplinary research. 	1998	200084:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	3	0	0.181818182	0.227272727	0.181818182	0.045454545	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.045454545	0.136363636	0	0.136363636	0	0.068181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.181818182	0	0	0	0.318181818	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.045454545	0.113636364	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068181818	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2140	" ;Stanford, Jack; "	Organization of Biological Field Stations	 The purpose of the workshop is to produce an action plan for networking data management and ecological monitoring at biological field stations.

The book will present and discuss a collection of case studies that showcase the use of basic ecological concepts to generate solutions to complex applied problems. Modern ecology as a basic science uses a blend of field surveys field and laboratory experiments and mathematical theory to generate general concepts on mechanisms and factors that govern the distribution and abundance of organisms. Part of the promise and justification for basic ecology lies in its potential for providing insights on applied issues such as conservation biology restoration ecology management of natural resources or pest species epidemiology or global change. Quantitative methods in basic ecology might be particularly important for addressing complex issues that are difficult to understand based on intuition alone. While it is clear that concepts in basic ecology have the potential to provide guidance on applied issues many if not most ecologists (and most of the general public) are poorly informed on specific examples that best exemplify the interface between basic and applied ecology.

The area where I hope to contribute is to connect ecological modeling with the modeling of natural resource economics. Two particular topics seem especially important. The first concerns the economic role of ecological stability. Perhaps surprisingly stability does not loom as a large consideration in an economic analysis of natural resource management. The typical way economists deal with a changing environment is to assume that the state of the environment is in fact knowable (like the monthly balance of trade) and that the policy can be changed to track changes in the environment. Obviously natural resources such as the size of fish stocks are not readily knowable nor are the control variables such as the harvest rate easily implemented or quickly adjusted as conditions change. Who knows how many fish will actually be caught by law abiding fishermen even though the harvest quota has been set to some specific value?The second issue in ecological economics that I will be working on involves the extension of optimal harvest theory to multi component ecosystems and to include ecosystem services other than direct harvests. There is very little that has been done in this area theoretically.  	1998	199999:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	61	3	0.02	0.08	0.36	0.02	0.02	0.04	0.12	0.02	0.08	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0.2	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.070175439	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0.01754386	0	0.105263158	0	0.140350877	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.140350877	0.035087719	0.035087719	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.052631579	0.157894737	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2158	" ;Bradshaw, Gay; "	Restoring the landscape: An analysis of Native American approaches to ecological restoration	 From the perspective of complex adaptive systems (CAS) the historic persistence of indigenous cultures on North American landscapes prior to European settlement suggests that social systems land use practices and landscapes were highly adaptable and resilient.

However virtually all marine ecological observational records are too short or infrequent for useful time series analysis so that prediction of ecological responses to further perturbations is difficult or impossible. Paleoecological archeological and historical data (hereafter referred to as paleo data) are the only hope for obtaining the necessary long term perspective. Paleo data are necessarily descriptive rather than experimental and differ from most observational ecological data in terms of the parameters measured and the common use of geochemical and paleontological proxies to estimate environmental and biological change. Consequently there is much misunderstanding and suspicion of the potential rigor of paleo data among ecologists that hinders their application to help solve ecological problems. The purpose of the proposed working group is to critically examine the potential of paleo records to extend marine ecological time series through a series of concrete examples. 	1999	2002140:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	4	0.076923077	0	0.025641026	0.333333333	0.076923077	0	0.051282051	0.051282051	0	0	0.230769231	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.025641026	0.051282051	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0.029850746	0.089552239	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.044776119	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.223880597	0.044776119	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0.089552239	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.074626866	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.089552239	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2234	" ;Micheli, Fiorenza; "	Joint effects of top down and bottom up forces on the structure and dynamics of estuarine and coastal marine communities: Interactions between nutrient inputs and fisheries exploitation	 I propose to conduct a review and synthesis of existing information on the joint effects of bottom up and top down forces on the ecosystem dynamics of estuarine and coastal marine communities.

The nursery role of these habitats is a pervasive concept and it is important in research conservation and management. There is however growing recognition that the evidence that supports this paradigm is not cohesive and sometimes weak or contradictory. A clear understanding of the importance of seagrass and wetland habitats in the life cycles of marine species is urgently needed because these habitats are declining rapidly worldwide. In the USA the recently revised Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act requires all eight Regional Fishery Management Councils to define protect and restore   Essential Fish Habitat  . If seagrasses and wetlands are nursery grounds then new measures can and should be directed towards their conservation as Essential Fish Habitat.Our goal is to form three small working groups to critically evaluate the nursery role concept for seagrass and wetland habitats. We will determine the extent to which the density survival and growth of animals are greater in these habitats than elsewhere and examine the characteristics of these habitats that most affect secondary productivity. We will also use bioenergetic simulation models to estimate the contribution of seagrasses and wetlands to offshore secondary production and examine the predicted effects of the continued loss of these habitats. We plan to synthesize and make these results useful not only to scientists but also to NGOs and state and government agencies to better inform management and conservation of coastal environments.  	1999	2002160:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	62	4	0.007692308	0	0.038461538	0.315384615	0.007692308	0.023076923	0.169230769	0.015384615	0.084615385	0.069230769	0.023076923	0.1	0.007692308	0	0.030769231	0.107692308	0.031446541	0.012578616	0	0.006289308	0.006289308	0	0	0	0.025157233	0.031446541	0	0.006289308	0	0.006289308	0	0	0	0.006289308	0	0.006289308	0	0	0	0	0.025157233	0.006289308	0	0.006289308	0	0	0.006289308	0.031446541	0.006289308	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012578616	0	0.012578616	0	0	0.006289308	0	0.062893082	0	0.012578616	0.006289308	0.006289308	0	0	0.012578616	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.006289308	0.018867925	0.012578616	0.446540881	0.031446541	0	0	0	0.012578616	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.006289308	0	0	0	0.006289308	0	0	0.006289308	0	0.006289308	0	0	0.037735849	0	0.012578616	0.006289308					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2283	" ;Warner, Robert; "	Open vs. closed marine populations: Synthesis and analysis of the evidence	 The major unanswered question in marine ecology is the degree of connectedness between local populations. Put another way what proportion of young arriving into a local population are products of local production? What is the source of recruits for any local population and where do the young produced in a local population go? The answers to these questions are unknown for any widespread species with a pelagic dispersal phase. Proper marine management depends on knowledge in this area: the efficacy of any reserve design for example is highly dependent on the degree to which it is dependent on other populations for recruitment and the degree to which it supplies other areas.Since most marine animals have a pelagic larval stage the paradigm thus far has been to assume extensive dispersal and massive export. In contrast I suggest that evidence is accumulating in a variety of fields (detailed below) that indicates a surprising amount of local retention even in species with long larval durations. If such retention turns out to be a common feature of local marine population dynamics this will require major reassessment of marine metapopulation models fishery management schemes marine reserve designs and ideas about the mechanisms of marine speciation. It is time to assess the evidence for open populations  strongly connected local populations best approached through metapopulation models) vs. closed populations  dependent on local production similar to many terrestrial systems) in the marine environment.An assessment of the prevalence of open vs. closed populations has been hampered by the diverse nature of the evidence. Many workers have pieces of the puzzle and we need to gather them together. This proposal has two components:1. A working group will convene to identify and share the most important areas of evidence sources of data and common methods of analysis. This group will consist of workers in the following areas: life history characteristics of endemic species geographic genetic structure of marine populations patterns of spread of introduced species larval distributions ecology and behavior near shore oceanography marine paleoecology empirical studies of recruitment proximal effects of marine reserves   dir    dir  2. As a Center Fellow I will coordinate the group and work with NCEAS staff to help the group to gain access to and synthesize the evidence. Many in this group will not have realized the connections between their disciplines until they meet over this common problem and most will not have analyzed their data from the perspective of open vs. closed populations. One of the most important tasks of this group will be to assess the evidence critically: what is evidence to indicate the degree of retention in a marine population and what are alternative explanations for the patterns seen?  	1999	2000292:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	50	4	0	0.25	0	0.5	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		5980	" ;Bakarr, Mohamed; "	Global Gap Analysis: An assessment of the global network of protected areas		2003	2003314:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	4	0.023255814	0.104651163	0.11627907	0.151162791	0.104651163	0.058139535	0.034883721	0.023255814	0.058139535	0.023255814	0.104651163	0.023255814	0.081395349	0.046511628	0.011627907	0.034883721	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0.145454545	0.045454545	0.1	0	0.063636364	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0.045454545	0.063636364	0	0	0	0	0.027272727	0.027272727	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0.063636364	0.018181818	0.072727273	0	0.054545455	0.027272727	0.018181818	0	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.027272727	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.027272727	0.009090909	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6860	" ;Sala, Enric; Worm, Boris; "	Linking marine biodiversity to ecosystem functions and services	 Biodiversity or biological diversity is the variation of life at all levels of organization from the level of genetic variation within and among species to the level of variation within and among communities ecosystems and biomes. It is well documented how human impacts are changing biodiversity in terrestrial (Wilson 1999) and marine ecosystems (NRC 1995). Historical studies in marine systems have further shown that long term impacts often lead to the simplification of food webs as species and species groups are driven to such low abundances that they become functionally extinct (Jackson . 2001 Lotze and Milewski 2002). The general consequences of these trends and changes for ecosystem functions such as primary and secondary productivity carbon and nutrient cycling food and habitat provision are little understood in marine systems. The recent research focus on biodiversity however has generated a significant albeit diffuse body of theory and empirical studies. Without synthesis it is difficult to communicate to the public and to environmental managers why marine biodiversity matters what the ecological and economic consequences of species loss and changes in biodiversity are and how dramatic consequences can be prevented. The proposed working group aims to fill this gap. In addition to quantifying the link between marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning we will analyze the potential for the disruption of marine ecosystem services which are those functions that are vital to our food supply economies and human health (see Fig. 1). Finally we will use the results from our analyses to evaluate the costs and benefits of maintaining the status quo versus implementing significant global conservation measures. In three consecutive workshops we will (1) collate experimental and observational evidence on how marine biodiversity and ecosystem functions are linked in a web accessible database (2) conduct and publish a series of meta analyses to derive generalizations about the effects of species loss ecological simplification and changes in marine biodiversity on ecosystem functions and services (3) write a policy paper that translates our results into management strategies. 	2003	2006318:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	62	4	0	0.15625	0.125	0.25	0	0.09375	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0.09375	0.09375	0	0.0625	0.0625	0.055555556	0.083333333	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.055555556	0.083333333	0	0.027777778	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0.083333333	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0.111111111	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.027777778	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6920	" ;Parrish, Julia; "	Marine conservation	 Marine conservation is a fast emerging multi discipline responding to the depletion of resources in the marine environment.

Poor science can doom the implementation of wise marine conservation practices but naivete among scientists regarding the policymaking process also can slow the application of good science. I propose two major goals for my time as a Center Fellow on sabbatical at NCEAS during 2003 2004. First I will write a book tentatively titled Marine Conservation: Integrating Science and Policy. This book will follow on the heels of another book on Marine Conservation Biology: The Science of Sustaining the Seas Island Press 2003 which I am co editing with Elliott Norse of MCBI. The new book will be co authored by Mike Orbach and derives from the Conservation Biology and Policy Course we have taught at the Duke University Marine Laboratory since 1997. Second I plan to learn more about the science policy integration process by working with an interdisciplinary group of people who deal with marine conservation from disciplines other than my own including anthropologists economists lawyers journalists marketing people governance experts fishermen and environmentalists. The current working group on Marine Management (Francis and Kitchell) of which I am a member is holding its first meeting with people from this broader interdisciplinary group in December 2002. One lesson from previous NCEAS syntheses like the one on Marine Reserves (Lubchenco .) is that even after the science is synthesized there is much new interdisciplinary work required to implement a marine reserve. The current working group on Pratical Design of Marine Reserves (Hastings and Botsford) is addressing these issues relative to marine reserves. The purpose of my sabbatical will be to provide a roadmap for ecologists orienteering through the policy landscape. 	2004	2004324:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	47	4	0.178571429	0	0.035714286	0.357142857	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0.142857143	0	0	0.071428571	0	0.071428571	0.107142857	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0.107142857	0	0	0.071428571	0	0	0	0.107142857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.071428571	0.035714286	0	0	0	0.214285714	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.107142857	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7280	" ;Harvell, Drew; "	The ecology of marine diseases 	 I am requesting funding for one more meeting of the Marine Disease Working Group.

There is increasing recognition of the impacts of human activities in the coastal zone and the need for conservation policy and design of coastal management systems to account for these impacts. The goal of the working group with funding from the Resources Legacy Fund is to identify key principles and research needs for a scientifically credible approach to conservation site prioritization design and ecosystem management in coastal environments.

The U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy and the Pew Oceans Commission both recommend ecosystem based management of the 4.4 million square miles of ocean within the jurisdiction of the United States. The Pew Oceans Commission Report as well as numerous scientists managers and advocacy organizations has called for development of ocean zoning as a key component of ecosystem based management. Ocean zoning is the authoritative regulation and allocation of access and use to specific marine geographic areas. Zoning systems aim to separate competing uses reduce conflict increase certainty among users and protect sensitive marine resources. Fisheries management has increasingly used spatial regulation to determine access protect nursing and spawning areas reduce gear impacts etc. More recently place based marine management is growing through the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs) including fully protected no take reserves and areas offering protection from a limited set of uses. This working group will bring together ecologists and social scientists to explore the concept practice and opportunities for ocean zoning in a unique political and social climate primed for change. We will focus particularly on the question of whether or not and how zoning systems can be used to implement ecosystem based management of oceans within the jurisdiction of the United States. The working group goals are to: (1) compile and synthesize information on existing systems of ocean zoning and their ecological and social impacts (2) compile and synthesize available ecological and social data necessary to design and develop effective zoning systems (3) develop the concept of ocean zoning within the context of ecosystem based management and (4) design a set of principles and policies for creation of sustainable and resilient ecosystem based ocean zoning systems. We have identified a group of leading thinkers engaged in developing an understanding of the complex ecological and social dynamics of ocean systems. The resources of NCEAS will enable us to bring these experts together to advance our understanding of marine ecosystems and our ability to implement scientifically based and effective ecosystem management. 	2005	2007376:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	31	4	0.011627907	0.104651163	0	0.26744186	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.081395349	0.011627907	0.069767442	0.046511628	0.104651163	0.034883721	0.220930233	0.034883721	0	0.096385542	0	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0.084337349	0	0	0.13253012	0.024096386	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0.036144578	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.036144578	0	0.144578313	0	0.036144578	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.024096386	0	0.024096386	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.012048193	0	0.012048193	0	0.036144578	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.108433735	0.024096386	0.012048193	0.012048193	0.012048193	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024096386	0.012048193	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9382	" ;Padilla, Dianna; "	Non native species introductions in marine reserves and protected areas	 This proposal is for sabbatical support as a Center Fellow to conduct two projects. (1.) Aquatic ecosystems have been impacted by a variety of anthropogenic factors leading to concerns about loss of biodiversity loss of fisheries stocks and the introduction and spread of non native species. In response there has been a dramatic increase in scientific and public attention to the protection of biodiversity and fisheries through marine reserves and protected areas and the introduction and impacts of non native species. Although these topics have been the focus of much recent effort to date there is a lack of attention to the problem of non native species in marine protected areas and reserves which will be the focus of my project. For marine systems this problem may be especially important because dispersal and connectedness among marine reserves appears to be a key design features for effective reserve design. These very properties can enhance the likelihood of invasion and spread of non native species. Marine reserves may also be especially susceptible to aquaculture species which either escape culture or are deliberately out planted in large abundance to enhance sustainable fisheries and restore ecosystem function that has been lost due to over harvesting. (2) The ecological importance and consequences of phenotypically plastic traits is of great interest to a wide range of scientists. I propose to review the literature on inducible offenses traits that enhance the ability of consumers or competitors and contrast this information with what is known about inducible defenses which have been studied much more extensively. I will explore the similarities and differences between these two types of ecologically important plasticities. 	2005	2006377:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	2	4	0.038461538	0.294871795	0.025641026	0.448717949	0.012820513	0.038461538	0.025641026	0	0	0.025641026	0.012820513	0.064102564	0.012820513	0	0	0	0.011111111	0.177777778	0	0	0.022222222	0	0.011111111	0	0.177777778	0.022222222	0	0	0	0.011111111	0.011111111	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0.033333333	0.011111111	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0.066666667	0.011111111	0	0.011111111	0	0.011111111	0	0	0	0.144444444	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0.011111111	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011111111	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0	0.111111111	0	0	0	0.033333333					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9400	" ;Selkoe, Kimberly; Lenihan, Hunter; Micheli, Fiorenza; Halpern, Benjamin; "	Putting ocean wilderness on the map: Building a global GIS atlas of pristine marine environments	 Terrestrial conservation has long recognized the need for setting global priorities and a common strategy for such efforts has been to focus on wilderness or pristine areas. Only recently have conservation groups begun to consider marine ecosystems and efforts to take a global approach remain nascent at best. In order to move forward conservation groups need global scale data on which to base their priority models but such data are currently highly dispersed and poorly synthesized. We propose a working group to address two questions that should greatly help close this gap: first what is a pristine marine ecosystem and second where are the remaining pristine areas of the world s oceans? The definition of pristine will be based on an ecologically rigorous assessment of anthropogenic influences on marine ecosystems and will guide us in identifying existing global scale datasets that we will use to map the distribution of pristine areas across all marine environments. Our final product will be a GIS based interactive atlas of the pristine and impacted areas of the ocean that can be used as a practical tool by conservation groups in developing marine conservation priority models by academic scientists in future ecological and biogeographic research and by educators in efforts to increase awareness of ocean conservation needs. 	2005	2008392:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	74	4	0.013157895	0.078947368	0.078947368	0.381578947	0.013157895	0.078947368	0	0.065789474	0	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.039473684	0.118421053	0.013157895	0.052631579	0.013157895	0	0.019047619	0	0	0.019047619	0	0	0	0	0.00952381	0.038095238	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0.019047619	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0.00952381	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0.028571429	0.00952381	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.00952381	0	0	0.066666667	0.00952381	0.00952381	0.00952381	0	0.038095238	0	0	0	0.123809524	0	0.00952381	0	0	0	0	0.00952381	0.00952381	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.00952381	0	0	0	0.00952381	0	0	0	0	0.228571429	0.028571429	0	0.00952381	0	0	0	0.00952381	0.00952381	0.00952381	0.019047619	0.019047619	0	0.00952381					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10002	" ;Orth, Robert; Dennison, William; "	Global trajectories of seagrasses: Establishing a quantitative basis for seagrass conservation and restoration	 Seagrasses are a group of flowering plants that have evolved a unique set of characteristics to live grow and reproduce in marine underwater habitats with key ecosystem services that they provide to coastal areas of the world. During the past two decades there has been a significant increase in the number of studies on the distribution abundance biology and ecology of seagrasses including the recent publication of a seagrass atlas; methods book and research synthesis. However the need for a better understanding of seagrasses today has taken on a new meaning and increased urgency. The rate of ecosystem alteration in coastal regions where seagrasses reside is accelerating and these alterations are occurring globally. The very survival of seagrasses which have been present for the past 100 million years depends on their ability to cope with these natural and anthropogenic alterations. The goal of the Global Seagrass Trajectories working group and the designated sub groups will be to use quantitative approaches to critically evaluate the types of changes that seagrasses are experiencing and evaluate likely causes. A previous qualitative examination of the literature indicates that seagrasses are experiencing loss rates which match or exceed those of other threatened coastal habitats such as salt marshes mangrove forests and coral reefs for which there is ample scientific and social awareness. Yet a global assessment with quantitative data for seagrasses is lacking and is the focus of this effort. Synthesizing available information and conveying them to the broader scientific community and society in an effective way will be a key outcome of this project. 	2006	2007394:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	83	4	0.012048193	0.048192771	0.036144578	0.301204819	0.168674699	0	0.036144578	0.048192771	0.048192771	0	0.048192771	0.036144578	0.012048193	0.024096386	0.156626506	0.024096386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027272727	0	0.036363636	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.036363636	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.036363636	0	0.036363636	0	0.027272727	0.009090909	0.027272727	0.009090909	0	0.027272727	0	0	0.081818182	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.045454545	0.009090909	0	0.063636364	0	0.009090909	0	0	0.036363636	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.009090909	0.054545455	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.063636364	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0.263636364	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10041	" ;Smith, Jennifer; "	Coral reef degradation: Determining the relative role of top down and bottom up factors in the global decline of coral reefs	 Coral reef ecosystems are among the most diverse and highly productive ecosystems on the planet yet are currently threatened by a number of natural and anthropogenic factors. Regardless of the cause reef degradation generally results in an irreversible phase shift from dominance by reef building coral to dominance by fleshy macroalgae. These shifts are believed to be irreversible and lead to communities that are less diverse and much less complex. While a number of natural disturbances can cause localized coral mortality reduced top down control (caused by overfishing) and increased bottom up control (caused by nutrient pollution) are the most frequently implicated causes of anthropogenic reef degradation. Past research has focused on either one or the other of these factors independently has involved large scale field based correlations and more recently involved factorial field and laboratory manipulations. However despite much effort there is not consensus in the scientific community as to how these factors independently and interactively influence phase shift formation. Further not all phase shifts are alike; some result in blooms of a single species of algae while others result in a more diverse mixed species assemblage and still others involve invasive non indigenous species. Through analysis and synthesis of data from the literature I propose to develop conceptual models to determine the relative strength of top down versus bottom up control on coral reefs. I also propose to conduct a meta analysis of these data to test several hypotheses regarding the importance of top down and bottom up control across several gradients in the tropics including latitude diversity and disturbance. Lastly using a pre existing database I will assess the role of top down and bottom up factors on the success of exotic macroalgae on tropical reefs and conduct a risk assessment to identify species that are likely to be more invasive than others. The information generated by this project will be highly useful in implementing sound science based management decisions for conservation of coral reef ecosystems across the globe. 	2005	2008413:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	4	0.06779661	0.06779661	0.050847458	0.423728814	0	0	0.152542373	0.050847458	0.016949153	0	0.033898305	0.016949153	0	0.016949153	0.06779661	0.033898305	0.029411765	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.044117647	0.220588235	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0.044117647	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.073529412	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0.073529412	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10741	" ;Selkoe, Kimberly; "	Elucidating marine dispersal with population genetics: A simulation approach with case studies on the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and the Pacific coasts of Baja and Southern California	 Our basic understanding of marine population ecology and our ability to successfully manage ocean resources depend on a better understanding of marine larval dispersal.

In marine systems these effects have recently become disturbingly apparent. 60 PeRcEnT of the world s fisheries today are fully or over exploited and the trophic structure of marine communities has undergone dramatic changes as a result of the loss of top predators. Marine reserves are quickly becoming one of the major strategies for ameliorating these negative impacts. Like terrestrial reserves marine reserves are based on fundamental theory provided by island biogeography and metapopulation biology that predict species persistence and colonization rates will increase in larger and less isolated habitats. Marine systems however differ from their terrestrial counterparts which has led to the general belief that landscape structure  habitat area patch shape proximity and the use of movement corridors and stepping stones) is generally a non issue in marine ecosystems. However the usefulness of theory originating from terrestrial reserve design may largely depend on the specific habitat types chosen. There are strong similarities between nearshore coastal habitats and terrestrial plant communities making it likely that the effects of connectivity and patch shape also operate similarly in these systems.I propose the first test of large scale habitat configuration effects on species diversity and composition over time in kelp forests using rare long term datasets from the Santa Barbara Channel. This project will determine the effects of the spatial arrangement of habitat in kelp forests on community composition and species abundances and distributions and will provide a differential tool that can be used to assess the importance of connectivity and patch shape for species with different life history traits at two different scales. I will use a combination of traditional multivariate statistics and Hierarchical Bayesian Modeling (a new computational statistical technique to assess complex spatiotemporal problems) to determine if the degree of patchiness at two different spatial scales (between and within reefs) has increased over time due to human induced impacts  urchins pollution climate variability). Using a cross disciplinary approach I will apply tools from terrestrial landscape ecology to quantify suitable habitat for kelp and determine if the area isolation and shape of available substrate affects kelp colonization and turnover. I will use this same approach to determine if kelp forest patchiness affects the distribution and abundance of marine species and whether life history traits (reproductive mode planktonic larval duration vagility) can predict species responses. Finally I plan to then use existing global datasets to determine if the local findings are generalizable across kelp forests.To meet these proposed goals I will utilize my strong background in terrestrial reserve design dispersal dynamics database management and multivariate spatial statistics. I will develop collaborations with leaders in bioinformatics biogeography and marine reserve design at the University of California Santa Barbara and the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) which will allow me to complete the proposed research successfully in fellowship time frame.

Josh; "	Exploring compensatory mitigation and markets as mechanisms for resolving fisheries bycatch: Biodiversity conservation conflicts	 The social and economic importance of fisheries and the biological realities of its impacts results in cardinal tensions over ocean resources. Fisheries provide approximately 16 PeRcEnT of all protein consumed by humans and are valued at US DoLlQuAnT 82 billion annually. However eight percent of the global fishery catch is bycatch which is discarded; resulting in major impacts on marine systems. Increasingly institutions are pressuring for sustainable management of species impacted by fisheries. Where bycatch cannot be avoided fishery closures are being implemented often driven by lawsuits with costly outcomes for society. An offset approach to this conflict could facilitate high value uses of biological resources while making conservation gains for threatened species. Taking seabirds as an example fishers could be levied for bycatch and capital transferred to fund conservation actions on breeding colonies  the removal of invasive mammals the primary threat to seabirds worldwide). A preliminary analysis has shown eradication of invasive predators can be 12 times more effective from an economic cost conservation benefit perspective in comparison with fisheries closures. In addition transferable bycatch fees which could increase with endangerment also provide individual incentives for avoiding bycatch the most effective mechanism for sustainable management of fisheries. We are developing a general framework for this approach using seabirds and sea turtles as case studies. Given limited conservation dollars compensatory mitigation provides an opportunity to address a global concern maximize the return on investment of conservation interventions and forge an alliance between conservation and fisheries organizations circumventing costly and socio politically damaging battles over bycatch conflicts. 	2007	200844:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	12	4	0.014925373	0.149253731	0.134328358	0.328358209	0	0	0.044776119	0.014925373	0.059701493	0	0.089552239	0.014925373	0.044776119	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.059701493	0.051546392	0	0	0	0.041237113	0	0	0.082474227	0.020618557	0	0.06185567	0.195876289	0	0.010309278	0.041237113	0	0.010309278	0.020618557	0	0	0	0.12371134	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0.010309278	0.051546392	0	0	0	0	0.030927835	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020618557	0	0.010309278	0	0	0	0.010309278	0	0	0.134020619	0	0	0	0.010309278	0	0.010309278	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0.010309278	0	0	0	0.010309278	0.010309278					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2071	" ;Kitchell, James; Olson, Robert; "	Ecological implications of alternative fishing strategies for apex predators	 We ask support to a working group that will develop modeling tools intended to set alternative fishing practices in an ecosystem context for the yellowfin tuna fishery pursued in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO). We ask NCEAS to serve as the primary sponsor of this effort and offer joint sponsorship through the auspices of the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) based in La Jolla California. We propose to incorporate historical and recent data from the EPO with a new spatially explicit version of the Ecosim model. The effort will involve three phases: an initial development of the model rigorous evaluation of that through collaboration with key scientists external to the working group and a workshop held in collaboration with representatives of conservationist groups and fisheries agencies which will evaluate the policy options pertinent to development of sustainable fishery goals. The EPO is an ideal system to develop this approach first because the data availability rivals that of any pelagic system in the world and second because the three fishing strategies used by the EPO tuna fishery impact the ecosystem in markedly different ways more so than in other comparable systems. An NCEAS working group will maximize the potential to create a tractable method of addressing ecological interactions of the scale pertinent to a pelagic open ocean food web. The results will provide a basis for developing strategies to address urgent fisheries by catch issues set in an ecological context. 	1998	2000469:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	4	0.016949153	0.169491525	0.13559322	0.406779661	0	0.016949153	0	0.016949153	0.050847458	0.016949153	0.033898305	0.06779661	0.016949153	0	0	0.050847458	0.032967033	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0.054945055	0.241758242	0.010989011	0.021978022	0.065934066	0	0	0.208791209	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0.043956044	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.021978022	0	0.021978022	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0.153846154	0	0	0.021978022	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0.010989011	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12109	" ;Hilborn, Ray; Worm, Boris; "	Finding common ground in marine conservation and management	 There is increasing concern among scientists and the general public about the current state of marine fisheries and their supporting ecosystems. Recent scientific progress on this topic has been partly overshadowed by significant controversy on how to assess marine resources and how to address current problems in ocean management. Marine ecologists and fisheries scientists often tend to favor contrasting approaches and we observe that these schools of thought have polarized over time. We now recognize this situation as counterproductive and propose to address this controversy where possible. In the proposed Working Group we are trying to define common ground among marine ecologists and fishery scientists by (1) developing a unifying terminology and a common analytical framework for assessing marine fisheries and ecosystem change (2) applying this framework to a number of representative marine ecosystems around the globe and (3) assessing management successes and failures in order to identify a set of tools that have been proven to reverse trends of degradation in marine fish stocks and ecosystems. This process should also identify areas of continued disagreement important for focusing future research. In a final step (to be funded by a third party) we would present our conclusions to managers NGO and government agencies helping them to understand the progress that has been made. The central question we are trying to answer is: how can we merge contrasting objectives tools and scientific criteria among marine ecology fisheries science and management into a unifying framework. We envision that this group will be acting as a catalyst for joining scientific forces in a quest to sustain and restore valuable marine resources. 	2007	2009482:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	74	4	0.050632911	0.126582278	0.075949367	0.493670886	0.037974684	0	0.012658228	0.025316456	0	0.075949367	0	0.012658228	0	0.037974684	0.037974684	0.012658228	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0.070707071	0.01010101	0	0	0.04040404	0	0.01010101	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0.050505051	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0.01010101	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0.070707071	0.01010101	0	0.01010101	0.03030303	0.03030303	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.01010101	0.474747475	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12122	" ;Fleishman, Erica; "	Evaluation of declines of pelagic organisms in the upper San Francisco Estuary	 Abundance indices of four important pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (the low salinity regions of the San Francisco Bay Delta and Suisun Bay) delta smelt juvenile striped pass longfin smelt and delta shad have been declining since 2001. Delta smelt is an endemic species listed as threatened under both the California and United States Endangered Species acts. Protection of delta smelt often determines water management actions in the estuary affecting more than 22 million people in California and a multibillion dollar agricultural industry. Longfin smelt also is native to California. Striped bass and threadfin shad both are introduced species but they support valuable recreational fisheries.

Although there has been an increase in the number of marine reserves designated to manage marine resources there has not been a concomitant increase in our understanding of marine reserve theory. As a result reserve designs have often relied heavily on theory formulated for terrestrial ecosystems or on no theory at all. Recent research on open ecosystems suggests that marine reserves designed using these principles are likely to be ineffective at protecting marine communities over the long term. This fact along with constantly increasing human pressure on marine ecosystems indicates that a theory of reserve design specific to marine ecosystems is urgently needed.

We also wish to explore the ability of Bayesian analysis path analysis or other modeling approaches to draw inference regarding ecological relationships among pelagic fishes human actions and inherent variability in the estuarine system. 	2007	2010510:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	74	4	0.025316456	0.113924051	0.050632911	0.518987342	0.025316456	0.050632911	0	0.025316456	0.050632911	0.050632911	0.025316456	0.012658228	0.012658228	0	0.012658228	0.025316456	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0.01010101	0.01010101	0	0	0.02020202	0.01010101	0.03030303	0	0.03030303	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0.02020202	0	0.02020202	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0.01010101	0	0	0	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0.02020202	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.01010101	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0	0.02020202	0.01010101	0	0	0.01010101	0	0.04040404	0.01010101	0	0	0.01010101	0	0	0.02020202	0	0.02020202	0.434343434	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.090909091					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12198	" ;Fleishman, Erica; "	 Potential role of contaminants in declines of pelagic organisms in the Upper San Francisco Estuary California 	 In late 2004 scientists noted that abundance indices of several pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary (delta smelt age 0 striped bass longfin smelt and threadfin shad) had remained unusually low since 2001. Delta smelt is an endemic species listed as threatened under both the California and U.S. Endangered Species Acts. Protection of delta smelt often determines water management actions in the estuary which supplies drinking water to more than 22 million people and supports a multi billion dollar agricultural industry. The abundance of longfin smelt another native species has a strong positive relationship to freshwater outflow. Striped bass and threadfin shad are both introduced species that contribute substantially to the total biomass of pelagic fishes in the ecosystem and support valuable recreational fisheries. NCEAS and the Interagency Ecological Program are collaborating to convene several working groups on issues related to decline of pelagic organisms. We hope not only to gain a better understanding of the specific causes of the organism declines in the San Francisco Estuary but to place these declines in the broader context of estuarine assessment and management in other geographic regions. This working group seeks to investigate the potential influence on observed declines of contaminants such as pyrethroid use changes in wastewater discharge as Californias human population increases and changes in use of pesticides. Contaminants may be having chronic effects or effects on the food web rather than acute effects detectable by traditional bioassays. Wastewater includes steroids and other pharmaceuticals that can affect the endocrine and immune systems. There also may be maternal effects on eggs and larvae. 	2008	2009514:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	1	4	0.274193548	0.056451613	0.040322581	0.379032258	0.056451613	0	0.088709677	0.024193548	0	0.016129032	0.024193548	0	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0.008064516	0.30875576	0.004608295	0	0.023041475	0.050691244	0	0.004608295	0.041474654	0.004608295	0.013824885	0	0.193548387	0.004608295	0	0	0	0.004608295	0	0	0.00921659	0	0.087557604	0	0	0.01843318	0	0	0.00921659	0	0.004608295	0	0	0.00921659	0	0.032258065	0.004608295	0	0	0	0	0	0.00921659	0	0.004608295	0	0	0.032258065	0	0	0	0	0.004608295	0.004608295	0	0	0	0	0.00921659	0	0	0	0.013824885	0	0.004608295	0	0.00921659	0.01843318	0.00921659	0.004608295	0	0	0.004608295	0	0	0	0	0	0.023041475	0	0.00921659	0	0.004608295	0	0	0	0	0.004608295					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12204	" ;Sibert, John; Maunder, Mark; "	Public domain ADMB project	 AD Model Builder (ADMB) is a tool for developing integrated statistical models of complex systems. The principle advantages of the ADMB software suite over other approaches are rapid model development numerical stability computational speed precision of model estimates and the capacity to accommodate relatively large numbers of parameters and data points. The ADMB software has earned acceptance by researchers working on all aspects of resource management. Population models based on the ADMB software are used to monitor more than 150 different sensitive endangered species and commercially valuable fish stocks around the world. The populations modeled using ADMB include such diverse species as whales dolphins sea lions penguins albatross abalone lobsters tunas billfish sharks rays anchovy and pollock. ADMB applications extend beyond stock assessment. ADMB based software is used for applications critical to the development of place based management policies. ADMB is an essential building block of the methods used to reconstruct movements of many species of animals tracked with electronic tags. Spatially resolved populations models treat movement as an integral component of population dynamics and depend on ADMB for estimating movement parameters from data. ADMB applications are critical to the missions of fishery management agencies in the United States and abroad. Stock assessments for commercially important fish stocks and ecologically sensitive protected species around the world depend on ADMB. In the United States every NOAA Fisheries Science Center uses ADMB in some fashion and many  commercially important and sustainably managed fisheries depend on ADMB based stock assessments. These fisheries include for example the Gulf of Alaska pollock fishery which is widely hailed as sustainably managed. The value i of the fisheries dependent on ADMB based assessments is enormous. The combined landed value of tropical Pacific tunas and the Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea ground fish alone exceeds US DoLlQuAnT 10 billion. ADMB is also used at Universities and other academic and research institutions. Due to ADMBs wide use in fisheries assessment and management it is now taught in courses at several universities. The research organizations government departments and companies using ADMB the types of applications being used and a list of ADMB based publications are attached to this proposal. to users than software whose source code remains proprietary. Involvement of the user community in software development harnesses the power of distributed peer review and assures that the software will evolve in directions most useful to its users. Providing the ADMB software at no cost enables users with limited means such as students and scientists in developing countries to take advantage of sophisticated state of the art computing algorithms. In addition the community built around the open source software provides an ideal resource for assisting developing countries in adopting the technology. 	2008	2011540:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	15	4	0.02739726	0.164383562	0.150684932	0.465753425	0	0	0.01369863	0.02739726	0	0.01369863	0.04109589	0.01369863	0.01369863	0.01369863	0.01369863	0.04109589	0.032608696	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0.217391304	0.010869565	0.02173913	0.152173913	0	0	0.22826087	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0.010869565	0.097826087	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0	0.054347826	0	0	0.010869565	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0.010869565	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12307	" ;Hilborn, Ray; Worm, Boris; "	Finding common ground in marine conservation and management	 There is increasing concern among scientists resource managers and the general public about the current state of marine fisheries and their supporting ecosystems. Recent scientific progress on this topic has been partly overshadowed by significant controversy on how to assess marine resources and how to address current problems in ocean management. Marine ecologists and fisheries scientists often tend to favor contrasting approaches and we observe that these schools of thought have polarized over time. We now recognize this situation as counterproductive and propose to address this controversy where possible. To help address this concern the National Center for Ecological analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) is supporting a Working Group to define common ground among marine ecologists and fishery scientists by (1) developing a unifying terminology and a common analytical framework for assessing marine fisheries and ecosystem change (2) applying this framework to a number of representative marine ecosystems around the globe and (3) assessing management successes and failures in order to identify a set of tools that have been proven to reverse trends of degradation in marine fish stocks and ecosystems. This process should also identify areas of continued disagreement important for focusing future research. The central question we are trying to answer is: how can we merge contrasting objectives tools and scientific criteria among marine ecology fisheries science and management into a unifying framework. We envision that this group will be acting as a catalyst for joining scientific forces in a quest to sustain and restore valuable marine resources. Clearly one of the solutions to integrating the interests and efforts of fisheries biologists and ecologists is to expose young scientists to the goals and approaches of the various interested parties dealing with these issues. Accordingly NCEAS will coordinate a Distributed Graduate Seminar (DGS) to involve graduate students and mentors from six universities. 	2009	2010544:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	12	4	0	0.048780488	0.170731707	0.43902439	0	0.109756098	0.048780488	0.012195122	0.012195122	0.012195122	0.048780488	0.024390244	0.012195122	0	0.012195122	0.048780488	0.075	0	0.008333333	0.008333333	0	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0.008333333	0.383333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0.016666667	0	0.016666667	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0	0.008333333	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0.008333333	0.008333333	0	0	0.158333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008333333	0.016666667	0.008333333	0	0.008333333	0	0.016666667	0	0	0.025	0.016666667	0	0.008333333	0.008333333	0.025	0	0	0.025	0.008333333	0.008333333	0	0	0	0	0.016666667	0	0.008333333	0	0.008333333	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12321	" ;Crowder, Larry; Smith, Martin; "	Envisioning a sustainable global seafood market and restored marine ecosystems	 Ecologists conservationists and economists agree that many of the worlds wild capture fisheries are overfished overcapitalized and continue to decline. At the same time global demand for fish protein is growing rapidly. Aquaculture provides an increasing share of the worlds edible fish protein but there are potentially adverse environmental effects of large scale aquaculture production. Wild capture fisheries and aquaculture together comprise the global seafood market. Though the deleterious impacts of fisheries and aquaculture on marine ecosystems have been widely studied few studies have focused on the mechanisms by which the global seafood trade contributes to declines in marine ecosystems and how this trade might be altered to support restoration of marine ecosystems. Also scientists from different disciplines mainly study the constituent parts of seafood production in isolation without an overarching vision of what an ecologically and economically sustainable seafood system would look like. This is the void in scholarship we seek to fill with a team of marine ecologists conservation practitioners natural resource economists and an anthropologist. We seek to explore three overarching questions: 1) Can we envision a global seafood system that is sustainable and does not degrade marine ecosystems? 2) Are there features of the global seafood trade that if enhanced could facilitate bottom up sustainability of individual fisheries and aquaculture operations? 3) Are there top down policy instruments or international agreements that would nudge the global seafood trade towards more sustainable practices? This study is timely and of vital importance and we believe we have assembled an ideal team to carry it out. By linking knowledge about how the global seafood trade works with knowledge about the ecological impacts of fisheries and aquaculture operations we will identify the pressure points to shift the global seafood trade away from harming marine ecosystems and towards a sustainable seafood system. 	2009	2011546:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	4	0.06	0.04	0.04	0.2	0.1	0.16	0.04	0.08	0.14	0	0.04	0	0	0.02	0.06	0.02	0	0	0.108695652	0.043478261	0.02173913	0	0	0.043478261	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0.043478261	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.043478261	0.043478261	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0.02173913	0	0.086956522	0	0	0	0.043478261	0.065217391	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12347	" ;O'Connor, Mary; "	Linking Physiological Rates and Community Ecology: Effects of Temperature on Food Web Dynamics and Population Connectivity	 Fisheries productivity and population connectivity are two complex ecological processes that are relevant to effective management of ocean resources but are very difficult to study directly.

Substantial changes in the biological communities of San Francisco Bay may have occurred in response to a state change in the California Current system after 1998. The state change was characterized by increased upwelling enhanced primary production and strong southerly flow. These changes in the near coastal ocean were associated with increased biomass of phytoplankton new seasonal phytoplankton blooms declines in the distribution and abundance of bivalve mollusks and high abundance of several predators of bivalves in San Francisco Bay. Processes in the near coastal ocean may have direct or indirect influences on abundance and survival of several fishes of management concern including longfin smelt striped bass and possibly delta smelt. Changes in the near coastal ocean might also influence survival of outmigrating juvenile salmonids including Chinook salmon and steelhead rainbow trout as they enter the ocean. These results indicate that proper understanding and management of the San Francisco Estuary requires knowledge of ocean processes as well as riverine and internal estuarine processes. The working group will attempt to examine the relative influence of processes in the near coastal ocean on the fishes and other organisms in the San Francisco Estuary. 	2008	2010563:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	4	0.059701493	0.223880597	0.208955224	0.268656716	0	0.029850746	0.089552239	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.06097561	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.304878049	0.012195122	0	0	0.146341463	0	0	0.134146341	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.012195122	0.06097561	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0.012195122	0.036585366	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0.012195122	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12381	" ;Costello, Christopher; "	Limited information fisheries management	 Effective and efficient fisheries management is often limited by available information and the high cost of collecting detailed fisheries data.

What are the similarities and differences between marine and terrestrial systems in terms of types and rates of responses? 2. Which marine species taxonomic groups and systems  pelagic benthic rocky shore sandy beach coral reef) are most sensitive? 3. What are the similarities and differences in the types and rates of responses in tropical temperate and polar seas? 4. Do multiple human stresses increase vulnerability of species and habitats to climate change? 5. Can we attribute change in marine ecosystems to climate change?

The health and productivity of these reefs are in serious decline from numerous threats ranging from local threats such as over fishing and pollution to the global threat of climate change. Local threats reduce the resilience of coral reefs to withstand global impacts from climate change resulting in deterioration of reef structure and the ability of these ecosystems to sustain their ecological interactions. We will assemble data from disparate sources to develop a framework for prioritizing between places and among specific conservation actions that cost effectively mitigate proximate land and sea based threats to coral reefs and apply it to regions within the Coral Triangle. With the overall goal of supporting decision making we will work in close collaboration with local managers and policy makers to synthesize this data and develop a framework that is capable of considering complex ecological social and economic dynamics relevant to the region. We will demonstrate its utility at local and regional scales and under different social and economic management constraints within the Coral Triangle. Typically management decisions on the land and sea are made independently without fully considering how terrestrial land uses impact marine biodiversity. Our work is novel as it is the first example of using economic theory to balance decisions between land and sea based management actions. This information will help guide decision makers in determining where when and how money would be spent efficiently to protect coral reefs sustain protein needs and foster livelihoods of millions in the face of a changing climate. 	2009	2011586:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	74	4	0.036363636	0.018181818	0.072727273	0.363636364	0.054545455	0.018181818	0.036363636	0.036363636	0.054545455	0.018181818	0.054545455	0.018181818	0	0.072727273	0.145454545	0	0.015384615	0.015384615	0	0	0	0.015384615	0	0	0.061538462	0.015384615	0	0	0	0.015384615	0.015384615	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015384615	0	0	0.015384615	0	0.030769231	0	0	0	0	0	0.015384615	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015384615	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.030769231	0	0	0	0	0.076923077	0.107692308	0.030769231	0	0.015384615	0	0	0	0	0.015384615	0.030769231	0.015384615	0.338461538	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015384615	0.076923077					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12467	" ;Schlenk, Daniel; "	Potential interactions between urban runoff and decline of pelagic fishes 	 Urban runoff has been identified as one of many potential drivers of the decline of pelagic fishes in the upper San Francisco Estuary. Participants in this working group will use an ecological risk assessment approach to address potential chemical influences on delta smelt longfin smelt threadfin shad and striped bass in urban environments. Housing and transportation infrastructure drains into spawning and nursery areas for these species. Three of the species spawn during months in which rain typically falls leading to substantial urban storm runoff. Shifts in the pesticides applied in urban environments from organophosphates to synthetic pyrethroids and more recently phenyl pyrazoles have coincided with steep declines in pelagic fishes. These newer pesticides have relatively long persistence times and may be transported in sediments into the fishes habitat. There is potential for relatively high toxicity to prey items for larval fishes as well as to early life stages of the fishes. 	2009	2010592:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	4	0.111111111	0.079365079	0.031746032	0.253968254	0.126984127	0.126984127	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.031746032	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.031746032	0.031746032	0.015873016	0	0.095238095	0.011363636	0.034090909	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0.056818182	0.045454545	0.102272727	0	0.170454545	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.056818182	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.056818182	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0	0.068181818	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12476	" ;Baum, Julia; "	 Predicting baseline current and future distributions and abundances of apex predators on coral reefs 	 Predators can exert important controls on ecosystem structure and function but are being rapidly depleted from the worlds oceans. Remote Pacific islands harbor many of the worlds remaining coral reef apex predator populations yet little is know about these species and they are increasingly threatened by fishing pressure. My research aims to advance understanding of the ecological physical and anthropogenic factors that determine the abundance of these species on reefs across the Pacific by integrating existing regional scale spatially explicit data into predictive species distribution models (SDMs). Robust cross validated models will then be used to predict geographically comprehensive predator distributions and abundances across the Pacific to hindcast quantitative baselines for these species and to forecast potential changes in their populations over the coming decades based on alternative management scenarios. Employing SDMs at the regional scale in the ocean represents a novel application of these models. This research is timely given the recent designation of many of remote Pacific reefs as U.S. national monuments. Research findings will be communicated to NOAA scientists and conservation practitioners with the aim of informing policy decisions for shark conservation. 	2010	2011594:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	83	4	0.011904762	0.023809524	0.011904762	0.214285714	0.130952381	0.095238095	0.023809524	0.011904762	0.095238095	0.011904762	0.011904762	0.095238095	0.095238095	0.047619048	0.047619048	0.071428571	0.036363636	0	0.072727273	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0.054545455	0	0.090909091	0	0.009090909	0.027272727	0	0.009090909	0.054545455	0	0	0.018181818	0.009090909	0.009090909	0	0.018181818	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0.027272727	0	0.045454545	0.009090909	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.018181818	0.045454545	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.018181818	0.009090909	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.245454545	0.009090909	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12478	" ;Gates, Ruth; "	Synthesizing molecular and ecological datasets to evaluate how diversity in coral endosymbiont communities (symbiodinium) maps onto environmental sensitivity in corals	 Climate change related increases in seawater temperature pose a serious threat to the worlds coral reefs. A key conservation issue and research priority is understanding how corals and coral reef ecosystems will respond to these environmental shifts. Changes in the composition of coral endosymbiont (Symbiodinium spp.) communities have been proposed as a mechanism by which corals might adapt to elevated seawater conditions in a time frame concordant with the rates of environmental change. As a sabbatical fellow at NCEAS I propose to develop the capacity to examine the biological support for this proposed adaptive trait by synthesizing ecological data on coral responses to thermal stress with molecular diversity data for coral endosymbiont communities. A major product of this effort will be a spatially contextualized Global Symbiodinium Database and Mapping Website that will provide an interface for any Internet user to perform text based or spatial queries of the database. I will use this powerful tool to examine how thermal history has influenced the present day global composition of coral endosymbiont associations and to evaluate whether corals that are ranked by ecological environmentally sensitivity exhibit differences in the nature and composition of their endosymbiont communities that are predictable within rank. The results of these analyses will be the subject of a review article styled for Biological Reviews or Coral Reefs and this work will contribute to the science necessary to complete the activities in a companion NCEAS working group proposal that will be submitted in January 2010 in collaboration with Peter Edmunds and titled Coral reefs of tomorrow: when the winners take over what will it be like?  	2010	2011595:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	50	4	0.027777778	0.148148148	0.12037037	0.268518519	0.009259259	0.009259259	0.027777778	0	0.018518519	0.157407407	0.064814815	0.009259259	0.046296296	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.055555556	0	0.00625	0	0	0	0.00625	0.00625	0	0.01875	0	0.025	0.01875	0	0	0	0	0	0.125	0	0.00625	0.00625	0.03125	0.00625	0	0.05625	0	0	0	0.04375	0	0	0.00625	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0.00625	0.025	0.0125	0.00625	0	0.03125	0	0	0.05625	0	0.00625	0.28125	0	0	0	0	0	0.00625	0.0125	0.01875	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0375	0.00625	0.00625	0.0125	0	0	0.0125	0	0.01875	0	0	0	0	0	0.00625	0	0.00625	0.01875	0	0.00625	0	0.0125					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12479	" ;Graham, William; Condon, Robert; Duarte, Carlos; "	 Global expansion of jellyfish blooms: Magnitude causes and consequences 	 Jellyfish are an important and often conspicuous component of oceanic food webs. During the past several decades dramatic spatial increases and temporal shifts in jellyfish distributions have been reported around the world. Undoubtedly there are associated ecological ramifications such as food web and biogeochemical pathway alterations. Moreover socio economic impacts include damage to fisheries industry and tourism. However reports have remained local in scope and scientists agree that a composite understanding of the extent of the problem is still lacking. The bottle neck is the lack of synthetic analyses across marine ecosystems due to the present fragmentation of data sources. This proposal will provide a global synthesis of reports of jellyfish abundance to achieve four main objectives: (1) to examine the hypothesis of a global expansion of jellyfish blooms and to explore the possible drivers for this expansion; (2) to examine the effects of jellyfish blooms on the ecosystem addressing in particular carbon cycling and food webs; (3) to identify current and future consequences of jellyfish blooms for tourism industry and fisheries including ecosystem based management on regional and global scales; and (4) to notify the public at large of the project results. The centerpiece of this project will be a scientifically coordinated global jellyfish and environmental database based on already identified datasets from coastal estuarine and open ocean regions. This is a two year project and meetings will be a combination of plenary and specific group level sessions involving data acquisition and statistical analyses global synthesis of trajectory maps of regional jellyfish blooms generation of conceptual diagrams of the role of jellyfish in biogeochemical cycles and food webs and discussions relating to the socio economic ramifications of jellyfish blooms. Discussions surrounding the framework of the database and identifying deficiencies and additional data requirements will take place in the first meeting. The deliverable products addressed in the proposal include: (1) at least six group publications submitted to major scientific journals in addition to several articles in the popular literature (2) several new process oriented proposals to be submitted to US and international funding bodies based on hypotheses generated from the database (3) multi lingual website and blog housed on the NCEAS network including the interactive jellyfish database and educational information on jellyfish blooms (4) two public seminars and discussion forums hosted in Spain and another one facilitated by NCEAS coinciding with one of the meetings (5) white papers designed for funding agencies and environmental managers identifying research priorities and protocols for monitoring jellyfish blooms and (6) a book detailing the biogeochemical ecological and societal aspects of jellyfish blooms. 	2009	201261:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	4	0	0.035714286	0.25	0.321428571	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0.071428571	0.107142857	0	0	0.035714286	0.071428571	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0.033333333	0	0	0.366666667	0.033333333	0	0	0.1	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0.033333333	0.033333333	0.066666667	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.133333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2096	" ;Debenham, Patty; "	SeaWeb	 Dr. Patty Debenham is a Center Associate and brings a relationship between NCEAS and SeaWeb.

This suggests that they are better adapted or possess community and or organismic attributes that make them less vulnerable or better equipped to recover. We propose to synthesize data from long term coral monitoring projects and the primary literature to identify biological attributes and physical conditions that associate with environmental resistance and resilience in coral species and reef communities.

Our group will create a framework outlining potential ecotoxicological impacts upon Gulf populations and communities with a primary goal of providing this information to decision making and funding entities in an expedited manner. 	2010	2010633:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	74	4	0.025	0.125	0.125	0.25	0.05	0.075	0.025	0	0.025	0.025	0.075	0	0.075	0.025	0.1	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0.022727273	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.022727273	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.022727273	0.113636364	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.068181818	0.113636364	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.159090909	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068181818	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12634	" ;Fleishman, Erica; "	Ecological thresholds in the San Francisco Estuary 	 Land use in the San Francisco Estuary since the mid to late 1800s likely has altered the system to the point that traditional objectives for restoration  reversion of structure composition and function to the original state of the system) cannot be achieved.

Managers must set limits to these sources of human caused mortality and disturbance to marine mammals without compromising human welfare. Currently the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) limits the allowable number of deaths caused by fisheries with a simple algorithm called Potential Biological Removal (PBR). NOAA has also recently committed to developing tools to depict underwater noise and the distribution and density of cetaceans. Although a vast improvement to the status quo there are still two major limitations associated with these approaches: 1) they do not consider the cumulative impacts of all threats and 2) assume largely unrealistic population dynamics. We propose to develop a new framework to incorporate cumulative impacts which also allows for more realistic population dynamics especially with respect to social complexity in marine mammals. Our analyses will provide managers with clear guidelines for managing the threats that marine mammals encounter in space and time. NCEAS is ideal for carrying out this work because there is no better boundary organization for bringing together academic and government scientists to discuss how to put science into policy. Moreover we anticipate significant data synthesis computation and dissemination which only NCEAS can accommodate. 	2013	2013665:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	4	0.029850746	0.089552239	0.268656716	0.373134328	0.014925373	0.044776119	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.029850746	0.029850746	0	0	0.025974026	0	0	0	0	0.116883117	0.207792208	0	0.116883117	0.025974026	0	0	0.012987013	0.012987013	0	0.038961039	0.025974026	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025974026	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0.038961039	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.064935065	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025974026	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0.051948052	0	0.012987013	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12670	" ;Halpern, Benjamin; Kappel, Carrie; Selkoe, Kimberly; "	Ocean tipping points (formally Ecosystem thresholds and indicators for marine spatial planning)	 An increasing number of examples of tipping points in ecosystems around the world have begun to raise concern among scientists and policymakers. In the oceans diverse ecosystems ranging from reefs to estuaries to pelagic systems have undergone sudden dramatic shifts. Changes in ocean climate the abundance of key species nutrients and other factors drive these shifts with resulting effects on ocean food webs habitats and ecosystem functions that have direct impacts on peoples livelihoods and well being. Ocean tipping points may be cause for particular concern because they are often unexpected and can be very difficult if not impossible to reverse. Though there have been many critical advances in the science of ecosystem tipping points in recent years there is still a dearth of practical tools and information available to managers to anticipate and respond to ecosystem shifts. Through this four year study the team will synthesize data on when where and how marine ecosystem shifts occur and develop early warning indicators and management tools to begin to help managers anticipate avoid or respond to tipping points. As ecologists lawyers and social scientists working in close partnership with managers the team is tackling these problems from both the science side and from the policy and implementation side. Working with local managers the team will implement ideas and test results in two case study locations: Haida Gwaii (in British Columbia) and Hawaii. 	2012	NaN679:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	12	4	0.081967213	0	0.327868852	0.360655738	0.016393443	0.016393443	0.032786885	0.032786885	0	0.016393443	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0.06557377	0	0.016393443	0.011494253	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0	0.183908046	0	0	0	0.206896552	0	0	0.114942529	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0.011494253	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011494253	0.068965517	0	0.011494253	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.011494253	0	0	0.022988506	0	0	0	0	0.022988506	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0.045977011	0	0	0	0	0	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12687	" ;Revenga, Carmen; Campbell, Stuart; Wilson, Jono; "	Managing Data Limited Fisheries for Economic and Biological Objectives	 Sixty four percent of global fisheries comprising 80 PeRcEnT of the global fish catch lack the data and resources to perform formal stock assessments.

To do so however requires spatially comprehensive as well as time series information of species distributions. In this regard the importance of detailed vegetation maps that cover large regions is substantial. Since such maps use remote sensing of the vegetation canopy as a primary input it is probable that direct characterization of the finest thematic unit will continue to rely on identification of dominant species. Most maps expressing dominant vegetation types label and define them as   alliances   under the National Vegetation Classification. Given the importance of vegetation alliances as units to model and manage biodiversity there has been surprisingly little work on understanding their behavior and rules of assembly. This study focuses on opportunities for developing a better basic understanding of alliances as a synthetic construct as well as their utility for conservation and as a vehicle for communicating ecological complexity. Are there additional ways to usefully categorize the behaviors or structures of individual alliance types? Are there general differences between the environmental response patterns of the plant species used to characterize an alliance and the other member species? Can individual alliances be characterized by a suite of functional morphological traits the physical adaptations of their constituent species to past environments linking species composition directly to environmental forcings? Could understanding and predicting the effects of climate change on biodiversity be enhanced by knowing the explicit relationship between certain plant functional traits or plant functional types and alliances? How does the alliance concept fit with contemporary species assemblage theories for example the core and satellite hypothesis the concept of nested hierarchies or of nestedness? Might additional metrics of alliances and their constituent parts offer new models for explaining patterns of species distributions along gradients? This study attempts to answer these and other related questions by assembling a large database of vegetation plots climate soils and morphological traits in the steppe and grassland ecosystem in the Columbia River Basin of North America covering about 30 million hectares. Gradient analysis ordination generalized additive models and fuzzy set theory will be applied to about 20 000 vegetation plot records a 500m grid surface of multiple daily meteorological parameters soils and importantly detailed morphological traits for each plant species. Results will be used to establish conceptual models for the conservation of these habitats and to show how this type of data driven approach to vegetation can lead to a robust predictive capability for managing biodiversity. 	1999	2001232:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	36	5	0.032258065	0.016129032	0.016129032	0.080645161	0.483870968	0.064516129	0	0.016129032	0.112903226	0	0.016129032	0.032258065	0	0.080645161	0.032258065	0.016129032	0.012987013	0	0.025974026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0.038961039	0.077922078	0.064935065	0	0.038961039	0	0	0.012987013	0	0.116883117	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.012987013	0.025974026	0.012987013	0	0.246753247	0.012987013	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.012987013	0	0	0.012987013	0	0.012987013	0	0	0.051948052	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.025974026	0	0	0	0.025974026	0	0.038961039	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3840	" ;Lortie, Christopher; Callaway, Ragan; Brooker, Robin; Michalet, Richard; "	Facilitation and competition on alpine elevation gradients: A global experiment on the organization of plant communities	 We propose to organize three meetings each 7 10 days in order to analyze data and develop conceptual empirical and mathematical models with a working group that has been loosely organized and conducting experiments on interactions in alpine plant communities around the world. Results from one of the nine sites for which data have been collected the French Alps and other preliminary analyses indicate that interactions shift from highly competitive in low elevation alpine meadows to highly facilitative in communities l1000m higher and near the physical limits of plant growth. These competitive and facilitative interactions also appear to be coupled with community properties such as biomass diversity evenness and the relative abundance of target species. Furthermore shifts in species interactions and the intensity of species interactions along elevation gradients appear to correlate with community characteristics and regional climate. We are requesting funds from NCEAS to solve the problems inherent to such a large group of investigators from different parts of the world with a large data set. Funding will allow us to work cohesively as a group on statistical analyses of experimental data to integrate experimental results with community properties in innovative ways and to develop empirical and conceptual models for the relationship between climate biogeography and plant interactions on gradients. 	2001	2003235:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	5	0.061538462	0.030769231	0.092307692	0.030769231	0.384615385	0.030769231	0.169230769	0	0	0.046153846	0.061538462	0	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.046153846	0.015384615	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0.034090909	0	0.034090909	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.318181818	0	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.034090909	0	0	0	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.068181818	0.011363636	0.022727273	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.034090909	0	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.068181818	0	0	0.034090909	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3920	" ;Leibold, Mathew; "	The Meta Community Concept: A framework for large scale community ecology?	 The concept of meta communities was developed in an effort to link community ecology theory at the local level with regional and global models at larger spatial scales. Currently there are two contrasting views of meta communities. The   patch dynamics   perspective is based on the idea that similar local habitat patches are colonized by species that interact to produce communities consisting of different species depending on their dispersal abilities. In contrast the   species sorting   view assumes that sites differ in their abiotic environment causing interacting species to sort themselves differently along gradients depending on their competitive abilities at different sites. The first view ignores local population dynamics and therefore allows for non equilibrial abundances but it ignores intrinsic heterogeneity among local sites. The second view is generally modeled using equilibrium models of local population dynamics but accounts for heterogeneity among sites. Empirical evidence suggests that both of these approaches are useful for understanding patterns in real communities. Thus there is a need for a more synthetic approach. We propose to form a collaborative group to work on such a synthesis. Our goal is to explore what happens when both sets of metacommunity processes occur. We hope to use this synthetic approach to explore their roles in regulating phenomena such as the trophic structure patterns of diversity and composition along environmental gradients and the role of regional processes such as dispersal in ecosystem processes. 	2001	2003275:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	10	5	0	0	0.125	0.09375	0.375	0.03125	0.0625	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0.0625	0.09375	0.09375	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.102564103	0.102564103	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0.051282051	0.076923077	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.102564103	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.102564103	0.025641026	0	0.025641026	0	0.102564103	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0.025641026	0	0.025641026	0	0.051282051	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		5200	" ;Huenneke, Laura; Diaz, Sandra; Chapin, F.

In animal studies biological allometries can usually be characterized as quarter power scaling relationships. The fact that quarter power allometries emerge at multiple levels of biological organization (physiology populations life histories) strongly suggests that one or a few critical mechanisms might link pattern and process within and between these levels. Recently in collaboration with G. B. West and J.H. Brown I have proposed a general hypothesis by which to mechanistically view biological allometries. This model is a deliberate oversimplification however we believe it captures the salient mechanisms dictating biological allometry. Most importantly extensions of this model can accurately account for several allometric scaling relationships in vascular plants. Perhaps its biggest insight is that although plant and animals differ allometrically they share numerous quarter power allometric scaling relationships. The underlying assumption of this work is that allometry offers a window by which one can critically investigate fundamental mechanisms influencing plant structure function and evolution. I propose to explore and test the specific predictions of this model in vascular plants by using various empirical measurements of vascular anatomy and physiology tied with computer simulation. The proposed research will specifically test the role of vascular systems in dictating plant architecture evolution and constraining ecological patterns in local communities. Overall the project represents a unique and strongly multidisciplinary approach to basic biological questions. It will permit the examination of these questions over evolutionary instead of historical time spans. Insights gained from this proposal are likely to yield creative and predictive results pertaining to the movement of resources in the ecosystem and the extrapolation of plant form and ecology in paleoenvironments. 	1999	2000330:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	5	0.039215686	0.117647059	0.078431373	0.117647059	0.254901961	0.039215686	0.039215686	0.039215686	0	0	0.117647059	0	0.039215686	0.019607843	0.078431373	0.019607843	0	0.057142857	0.028571429	0	0	0.014285714	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0	0.042857143	0.042857143	0.028571429	0	0	0.014285714	0.014285714	0.128571429	0.014285714	0.057142857	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0	0.042857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.085714286	0	0.014285714	0	0.028571429	0	0.057142857	0.014285714	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0.014285714	0	0.028571429	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0.014285714	0.014285714	0	0.014285714	0.014285714	0.014285714	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7600	" ;Halpern, Benjamin; "	Predicting community level responses to disturbance: Implications for reserve design	 Determining the causes of community stability and productivity remains an elusive goal for ecologists and conservationists alike.

While effects on organisms of changes in mean conditions have often been anticipated the potential effects of increasing variability have been relatively neglected. We propose a Stochastic Demography Working Group to assess how increasing environmental variability is likely to impact populations of plants and animals. Using unpublished demographic data for a diverse set of taxa and new theoretical tools developed by group members we will compare the effects of changes in the means vs. the variances of environmental variables as well as the pattern of sensitivity to environmental variability across species life histories and habitats. In addition we will ask whether the demographic processes that most influence population growth are the least sensitive to environmental variation a pattern that has been observed in the relatively small number of species previously tested and that would serve to buffer populations against increasing environmental variability. Our ultimate goal is to improve the ability of ecologists to forecast the consequences for the long term viability of populations of not only overall trends in environmental conditions but also expected changes in year to year variability. 	2004	2005379:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	33	5	0	0.02173913	0.043478261	0.02173913	0.391304348	0.065217391	0.065217391	0.043478261	0.130434783	0.043478261	0.043478261	0.065217391	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0.015873016	0	0.031746032	0	0.095238095	0	0.031746032	0	0	0	0.079365079	0.031746032	0.031746032	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.015873016	0	0	0.079365079	0.015873016	0	0.063492063	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0	0.111111111	0.015873016	0.063492063	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047619048	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.031746032					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9520	" ;Cleland, Elsa; "	The response of ecological communities to nutrient enrichment: Utilizing meta analysis and structural equation modeling to disentangle the influences of functional traits and environmental context	 Ecologists have been fascinated by the relationship between plant species diversity and ecosystem productivity for many years. It is becoming increasingly important to understand this relationship as anthropogenic environmental changes such as nitrogen deposition fundamentally alter natural systems. At local scales experimental research shows that species diversity tends to decline as resource availability increases. To date diversity responses to nutrient enrichment have been quantified almost entirely by changes in taxonomic richness. Thus we know little about the characteristics or functional traits of those species which decline. This research will seek to determine whether plant functional traits can predict shifts in species composition species richness and productivity in response to nutrient enrichment. This focus on functional traits will facilitate comparison across ecosystem types and generalization regarding species losses and their consequences in response to environmental change. 	2005	2008395:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	5	0.032258065	0	0	0	0.290322581	0.096774194	0	0.064516129	0.096774194	0.064516129	0.032258065	0.129032258	0.064516129	0	0.032258065	0.096774194	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.121212121	0	0	0.121212121	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.181818182	0	0	0	0.090909091	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0.03030303	0.151515152	0.03030303	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10081	" ;Stephens, Patrick; "	The effects of lineage age on the species richness of regional assemblages	 Like area time is a factor that must constrain diversity at some level yet very little is known about how time and species richness are related in most groups.

These theories have all yielded quantitative predictions that show striking agreement with patterns observed in nature. Furthermore all three theories derive predictions based on the same postulate that biodiversity is largely controlled by universal principles and processes that operate at the level of the individual organism and that therefore transcend species identity. Given this fundamental point of contact among theories and that each theory focuses on a different axis of ecological complexity (energy stochasticity space) considerable progress could be achieved by their integration. This working group will work towards unifying metabolic scaling theory neutral biodiversity theory and spatial macroecology. Our goal will not be to summarize research to date but rather to cross disciplinary boundaries and specializations to develop a prediction rich synthetic framework for the evolutionary and ecological assembly of biodiversity across multiple spatial and temporal scales. We anticipate a vigorous and systematic attack on the problem by researchers committed to improving their theories by confronting them with data. 	2007	2008461:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	33	5	0.064516129	0.032258065	0.080645161	0	0.241935484	0.016129032	0.112903226	0.016129032	0	0	0.048387097	0	0.241935484	0.016129032	0.112903226	0.016129032	0.104651163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.046511628	0	0	0.011627907	0.034883721	0	0.046511628	0.034883721	0.011627907	0.058139535	0.034883721	0	0	0	0.058139535	0.104651163	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0	0.11627907	0	0	0	0	0.034883721	0	0.023255814	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.011627907	0	0.011627907	0.011627907	0	0	0.011627907	0.046511628	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.069767442	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.011627907	0.011627907	0	0.011627907					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12069	" ;Cavender-Bares, Jeannine; Mack, Michelle; Ackerly, David; Reich, Peter; Burleigh, J.

We will use data from the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network and beyond to examine the influence of phylogenetic relationships on community structure and traits relevant to ecosystem processes at nested spatial and taxonomic scales across North America. In doing so we will break new theoretical ground and develop new experimental and statistical protocols. Despite growing interest in understanding the influences of phylogeny on ecological processes a synthesis across local and continental scales has yet to be attempted. Progress toward a unified understanding of the problem has been hampered by a lack of synthesis of existing phylogenetic and ecological data. A signature outcome will be a database of phylogenetic information for North American land plants and corresponding databases of plant traits and species abundances across local and large scale environmental gradients. A second outcome will be a set of user friendly software tools for statistical analysis of these data. These products will be used to clarify the significance of phylogenetic history and trait evolution for community organization and ecosystem processes across critical local and continental environmental gradients in North America. A North American synthesis will provide a framework for subsequent global analyses.

Understanding ecological patterns and predicting future changes including those caused by human impact necessitates a holistic approach covering large spatial scales and this will only be achieved by identifying retrieving and synthesizing diverse data from distributed sources: heterogeneous data from a global confederation of collaborating scientists including a broad range of disciplines. To address this pressing need we propose to network eight of the largest databases on plant inventories in the Americas to assemble an accessible and readily analyzable database warehouse on distributions and abundances. With it we will answer major questions of direct relevance to conservation of new world biota. In particular how does climate and latitude influence the relative distribution and abundance of narrow and widespread plant species? While this and associated questions have been mainstays for ecology our inability to integrate data has significantly limited our ability to answer them. The proposed working group will significantly improve our ability to finally answer these questions. We will also make distribution and abundance data widely available so that further analyses for example covering other plant taxa or particular regions will be possible. It is also part of our plan to continue expanding our meta database with additional inventories collections and plots not yet digitized plus future field work.

Finally we will develop analyses that will help to discern the relative importance of stochastic and deterministic processes that underlie the patterns of beta diversity in the assembly of communities. 	2009	2010611:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	33	5	0.00952381	0.038095238	0.019047619	0	0.580952381	0.00952381	0.00952381	0.019047619	0.038095238	0.057142857	0.028571429	0.047619048	0.066666667	0.00952381	0.066666667	0	0.0078125	0	0.0078125	0	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0.0390625	0.0078125	0.0078125	0.1484375	0	0.015625	0	0	0.0703125	0.0859375	0	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0	0.0234375	0	0.0546875	0	0	0.0078125	0.1953125	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0.0078125	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0.0078125	0.078125	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0234375	0	0.0703125	0	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0	0.0078125	0.0078125	0	0	0	0.0078125	0.0078125	0	0	0	0.0234375	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0078125	0	0.0078125	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12558	" ;Gross, Katherine; "	Predicting grassland community responses to fertilization: Exploring the role of clonality and other species traits	 Nutrient enrichment is predicted to be one of the top three drivers of biodiversity loss this century (Sala . 2000). It is therefore critical to understand how biodiversity will respond to elevated nutrient levels in different ecosystems including what species or functional groups will come to dominate in high fertility environments and why. In grasslands high fertility sites are often dominated by clonal species. The observation that declining or hump shaped diversity productivity relationships occur more frequently when clonal species are present suggests that clonal species may play an important role in community responses to nutrient enhancement. However the mechanisms underlying this effect or if there are specific traits of clonal species that determine their ability to dominate high fertility environments is unknown. As a Sabbatical Fellow as NCEAS I propose to address this question by analyzing data from fertilization experiments combined with data bases of species traits to determine if there are correlated traits that determine when clonal species will dominate in response to nutrient enhancement and if there is an environmental context (site history productivity soil fertility species and functional group composition) to this response. I have proposed three projects two which I expect to complete while a Fellow; the third I will initiate at NCEAS. The first two projects will build on my ongoing long term research in SW Michigan grasslands and involvement in the Productivity Diversity Traits Network (PDTNet). Using my own data the PDTNetwork and other published data I will conduct a multi variate analysis of species and environmental traits to determine what conditions promote (or preclude) dominance by clonal species in response to nutrient enrichment. The third project will be a literature survey to develop a global data base of published field experiments on grassland community responses to fertilization. This will form the basis of a trait based meta analysis and global synthesis of clonal species responses to and impacts on diversity in grasslands. I would expect this project to become the focus of a NSF RCN or future working group proposal to the National Center for Environmental Synthesis. 	2010	2011613:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	5	0.039215686	0.107843137	0.156862745	0.049019608	0.196078431	0.078431373	0.039215686	0	0.009803922	0.019607843	0.098039216	0.029411765	0.039215686	0.058823529	0.029411765	0.049019608	0.008196721	0	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0	0.040983607	0.016393443	0.139344262	0	0.12295082	0	0.040983607	0	0	0	0.098360656	0	0.016393443	0.024590164	0.016393443	0.024590164	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0.024590164	0	0.032786885	0.016393443	0.024590164	0	0.008196721	0.016393443	0.057377049	0	0	0	0	0.040983607	0.016393443	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0.024590164	0.008196721	0.016393443	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0	0	0	0.040983607	0	0.008196721					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12560	" ;Duffy, J.

Over the past two decades more than 200 experiments have examined how the diversity of bacteria fungi plants and animals influence important ecosystem processes in habitats throughout the world. Though diversity effects have by no means been universal recent summaries have revealed considerable generality in how the number of genes species and functional groups of organisms impacts the efficiency by which communities process the energy and matter that define how ecosystems function. These results suggest that modern biodiversity loss may have substantial impacts on the services that ecosystems provide to humanity. But the research remains controversial in part because results of often highly simplistic experiments have yet to be translated into meaningful predictions about how biodiversity loss will impact ecological processes in realistic systems at appropriate scales. We will overcome such limitations by accomplishing three goals at this frontier between academic and applied ecology: (1) We will develop quantitative scaling relationships that allow conversion of the results of small scale short term experiments into predictions about the fraction of species required to optimize biological processes in more natural ecosystems. (2) We will characterize how biodiversity simultaneously impacts the suite of ecosystem processes that have been measured in past experiments to identify trade offs and potential synergisms and to provide guidance on optimizing the multi functionality of diverse systems. (3) We will evaluate how the impacts of biodiversity on key ecological processes  biomass production) can be translated into ecosystem services  CO2 uptake and storage) that can be used to aid decisions in conservation and management. 	2010	2011615:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	5	0.027777778	0.055555556	0.055555556	0.027777778	0.25	0.027777778	0.166666667	0.055555556	0.027777778	0.027777778	0	0.138888889	0.027777778	0.083333333	0.027777778	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.204545455	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.045454545	0.022727273	0	0.045454545	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.159090909	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068181818	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.045454545	0.022727273	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.068181818	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12573	" ;Mittelbach, Gary; "	Community ecology in transition	 I propose to spend five months of my upcoming sabbatical leave at NCEAS working on two projects.

The stimulating intellectual environment of NCEAS with its excellent cadre of resident postdoctoral fellows sabbatical fellows and visiting scientists will provide unparalleled exposure to the latest ideas in ecology as well as the opportunity to get broad feedback on the contents and organization of the book. Not only will this benefit me by improving the quality of the final text and making it more useful to the ecological community but this project will also benefit the NCEAS community. I will use Ecolunch and other informal opportunities to share my ideas for how the subject of community ecology may be organized and taught (I have taught a graduate level class in community ecology at Michigan State University for  20 years). I am anxious to share this knowledge with others and to gather their input as well. In particular I believe the NCEAS postdoctoral fellows many of whom will end up with faculty positions teaching ecology will profit from this interaction. Thus I envision a productive synergy between this sabbatical project and the intellectual community at NCEAS.

The sites are part of the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) a collaboration of arctic and alpine researchers. ITEX programs have been in place throughout the circumpolar arctic and temperate alpine since 1992 or 1993. ITEX investigators use a common experimental design work with a common set of species and monitor common parameters of the ecosystem and physical environment. ITEX investigators seek to understand how the same species located in different geographical areas respond to warming and natural climatic variability and how changes in those species and their environments will affect overall ecosystem structure and function. A common assumption in ecological studies is that patterns of response in species (or other groupings such as functional types or ecosystems) can be directly extrapolated to the range of the species or type. Such an assumption is necessary if data are to be used in modeling and extrapolation studies. The ITEX data will allow us to explicitly test this assumption by examining variability in tundra responses at multiple sites over 4 5 years. We propose to meet these objectives by compiling and integrating data sets from ITEX research sites in order to test hypotheses of tundra response at a global scale using meta analysis techniques in a collaborative workshop setting.  	1996	1997148:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	50	6	0	0.095238095	0.023809524	0	0.047619048	0.333333333	0.095238095	0	0	0.166666667	0.047619048	0	0	0.166666667	0	0.023809524	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0.056603774	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.075471698	0	0	0.056603774	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.301886792	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.056603774	0.018867925	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2259	" ;Steffen, Will; "	Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems;A Synthesis	 The Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems (GCTE) Core Project of the IGBP aims to carry out a synthesis of its work over the first four years of operation. The synthesis will be based on two major themes. (1) the role of terrestrial ecosystems in the physical climate system and in global biogeochemical cycles; and (ii) the impacts of global change on terrestrial ecosystems based on in depth analysis of four or five regions around the world. This synthesis addresses both major areas of emphasis for NCEAS spatio temporal dynamics and ecosystem management; it interprets results from studies carried out at a wide range of scales from patch to global spatial scales and from seconds minutes to centuries in temporal scale. The major activity will be an intensive two week workshop in September 1996 involving key scientists (a minimum of 20) who have made major contributions to the GCTE effort. The synthesis will produce two products: (I) a document specifically aimed at the policy section that emphasises the relevance of the synthesis for resource management and policy issues; and (ii) a scientific volume.  	1996	1996169:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0.063829787	0.063829787	0.276595745	0.021276596	0.021276596	0.404255319	0	0	0	0.021276596	0	0.063829787	0.021276596	0.021276596	0.021276596	0	0	0.058823529	0.147058824	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0.058823529	0	0.014705882	0.029411765	0.044117647	0.088235294	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.058823529	0	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0.044117647	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.102941176	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2294	" ;Sala, Osvaldo; Chapin, F.

Each participant will be supplied with summaries of currently published IPCC scenarios of changes in climate atmospheric composition and land use for the next century. These scenarios include best case worst case and business as usual scenarios. We will also supply maps of natural vegetation composition under current climate and vegetation that is projected to be in equilibrium with a 2X CO2 world. This information will be sent to participants in late March prior to the meeting. We assume that there will be active discussion at the meeting about pitfalls and insights into how these scenarios can be made as credible as possible. We will ask each person to provide a written chapter by September following the meeting. There will be two major sections to the workshop and the final product: (1) a summary of the major drivers of changes in biodiversity and (2) a biome by biome analysis of the probable changes in biodiversity and their consequences for ecosystem functioning. In dealing with consequences we will encourage participants to consider both ecological consequences for functioning of natural communities and economic and social consequences for human society. Detailed outlines of each chapter must be available to exchange among participants at the meeting.

Both climatic changes (such as El Nino events) and societal demands for freshwater resources will likely cause drought impacts to be even more important in the future. An integrative analysis is needed to evaluate spatially specific impacts on stream food webs from drought altered riparian forests and to determine how stream communities reorganize in response to drought disturbances within a drainage network. This project will bring together forest ecologists stream ecologists hydrologists and climatologists to develop a conceptual framework that will examine linkages among drought frequency riparian forest litter fall benthic community composition and stream food webs. A review of published research will focus on long term study plots at several temperate zone and tropical sites where the drainage networks are spatially well defined and highly instrumented with a hierarchy of multiple stream gages. Digital elevation models will be used to define spatial boundaries of subsets within drainage networks and to examine pathways for multi directional dispersal of consumer species up and down stream channels. Because leaf fall is widely used as a measurement of forest productivity many previous studies have documented drought effects by recording changes in deposition rates of leaf litter. Trees often respond to drought conditions by rapidly dropping leaves to reduce water loss from evapotranspiration. Leaf litter in turn is the main source of energy to food webs in tributaries so that rapidly increased detrital inputs may alter species diversity of these headwater stream communities. The effects of extremely low flows on stream food webs in forested catchments are also widely recorded because stream flows are important for dilution of toxins and ecosystem integrity. Reduced stream flow can alter benthic detritivore distributions and further modify how energy flows through food webs. Simultaneous or sequential increases in primary production during droughts may also influence specific responses among omnivorous consumer species. Thus stream food webs can reorganize themselves into different structural assemblages after a period of changing physical conditions. As habitats contract during the drying out of stream channels some species adaptations for surviving and feeding in low flows change relative competitive advantages among benthic species and increase exposure to fish predators at different locations within a nested sequence of food webs distributed within a drainage network. How food webs respond to reduced flow will likely depend on specific locations with the stream channel hierarchy hydrological conditions  time lags for subsurface groundwater inflows to enter the stream) stream channel geomorphology (especially pool depths and catchment porosity) as well as riparian tree species composition and the starting composition of the benthic community. The project will identify gaps in knowledge as well as synthesize existing long term data on species responses to drought stress within drainage networks. 	2000	2001204:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	6	0.067307692	0.028846154	0.048076923	0.009615385	0.038461538	0.269230769	0.134615385	0.019230769	0.038461538	0.009615385	0.038461538	0.009615385	0.009615385	0	0.259615385	0.019230769	0	0.017699115	0.123893805	0	0.053097345	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0.008849558	0.008849558	0.03539823	0.008849558	0	0.14159292	0	0	0.053097345	0	0	0.061946903	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0	0.053097345	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0.017699115	0.044247788	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0.309734513	0	0.008849558	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3101	" ;Lavorel, Sandra; Flannigan, Michael; "	Global change impacts on landscape fires	 A major problem in projecting ecological change and understanding its mechanisms is the lack of non equilibrium dynamics in ecological models. The inclusion of disturbance especially fire is essential for dynamic vegetation models to simulate transient changes in vegetation composition and structure. Understanding landscape dynamics in relation to fire and how these dynamics may be altered by climate and land use changes is a priority. The development of fire vegetation models at landscape scales is a crucial gap in land management. Additionally understanding human impacts on the fire regime is critical for projecting vegetation change in human modified landscapes which now occupy large proportions of the globe. The objective of this working group is to use the current well developed understanding of fire behavior fire ecology and fire weather to develop a set of dynamic fire climate vegetation models that simulate fire effects at temporal and spatial scales relevant to vegetation change. We will use a common modelling environment LAMOS to conduct this research. LAMOS (a LAndscape Modelling Shell) is an interactive and flexible landscape modelling platform designed to include alternative methods for simulating vegetation response to landscape change. This proposal specifically addresses three questions: 1) How well do different landscape fire models reproduce fire statistics under current climate both with respect to each other and with respect to fire history records at selected sites 2) At what spatial and temporal scales does landscape pattern influence the fire regime and 3) Under which weather conditions are fire patterns sensitive to fuel landscape pattern and how often under present future climate is the threshold of sensitivity crossed. 	2000	2004208:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	85	6	0.111111111	0	0	0.027777778	0.083333333	0.388888889	0.027777778	0.027777778	0.027777778	0.111111111	0.027777778	0	0.055555556	0	0	0.111111111	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.065217391	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.065217391	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0.086956522	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.02173913	0	0.02173913	0	0.043478261	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.347826087	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3242	" ;Roberts, David; "	Synthesizing the new vegetation ecology	 Vegetation ecology is a science of breadth and significance in both pure and applied aspects.

Initial analyses and modeling efforts will focus on LMEs in the North Atlantic Basin while our eventual goal is to compare and contrast climate driven responses of shelf ecosystems in both the North Atlantic and North Pacific Oceans. 	2000	2001255:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	14	6	0.164835165	0.032967033	0.021978022	0	0	0.318681319	0.153846154	0.120879121	0.065934066	0.010989011	0.010989011	0	0	0.087912088	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.172131148	0	0	0	0.090163934	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.049180328	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0	0	0.008196721	0	0.016393443	0.016393443	0	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0.12295082	0.008196721	0.024590164	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.024590164	0	0	0	0	0.032786885	0	0	0	0	0.090163934	0	0	0	0.032786885	0.106557377	0	0	0	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0	0	0.008196721					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4500	" ;Porter, Warren; "	Putting physiology on a landscape scale	 In the summer of 2001 I will be making first principles calculations of how specific species use specific landscapes to maximize their potential for survival growth and reproduction. I will be testing these predictions against experimental data available on these specific species from my collaborators Dr. John Sabo Dr. Leah Gerber and Dr. Eric Seabloom postdoctoral fellows at NCEAS. I will make the calculations using my new high resolution spatially explicit combination of our microclimate ectotherm and endotherm biophysical energetics physiology behavior models. They now predict landscape scale habitat utilization and distribution for specific ectotherm and endotherm species. These predictions will be based in part on topographic data from digital elevation maps that include latitude longitude elevation slope and aspect at 30 m by 30 m resolution. Climate data from specific reference locations will be applied to each quadrat using adiabatic principles to estimate temperature differences with elevation. Locally available microclimates in each quadrat will be used to drive animal energetics behavior animal models. Results will be displayed in GIS format using ArcView. Optimal landscape locations that maximize activity time discretionary energy for growth or reproduction and minimal activity time and costs for maintenance metabolic rates and water loss rates can be identified on specific quadrangles where empirical test data are available. The work on lizards will be on the genus Sceloporus in collaboration with Dr. John Sabo. Predictions of activity time food and water requirements and growth and reproductive potential of dusky footed woodrats on the Los Olivos quadrangle will be done in collaboration with Drs. Leah Gerber and Eric Seabloom who have collected experimental data on these animals. 	2001	200125:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	7	6	0.017241379	0.051724138	0.017241379	0	0	0.482758621	0.017241379	0	0.017241379	0.189655172	0.051724138	0.034482759	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.086206897	0	0	0	0.109756098	0	0.036585366	0.012195122	0.170731707	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.012195122	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.036585366	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.06097561	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0.012195122	0	0	0.036585366	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.036585366	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0.012195122	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0.134146341	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.036585366	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0.012195122	0	0.012195122					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2040	" ;Chapin, F. Stuart; "	Arctic boreal processes that feed back to climate: Extrapolation and synthesis	 Changes in high latitude ecosystems are likely to have major feedbacks to global climate through changes in carbon storage trace gas fluxes and surface energy balance. These feedbacks to climate may occur as rapidly as any other changes on the earths surface. However there is currently considerable debate about even the sign of these climate feedbacks much less their magnitude. Two limitations to estimating high latitude feedbacks are (1) lack of integration of process level studies conducted over long time periods with estimates of regional variation in processes and (2) lack of explicit tests of the extrapolation of results from one region to another. This workshop is intended to address this gap for North American high latitude ecosystems. The workshop seeks to integrate understanding from five major high latitude climate feedback studies: BOREAS the Arctic FLUX study the Canadian Northern Wetlands Study and the arctic and boreal LTER programs in Alaska. The workshop is split into two consecutive sessions one on arctic boreal vegetation change and surface energy balance (April 6 9) and a second on arctic boreal CO2 and CH4 flux (April 10 13). Each session will be a combination of presentations of current understanding and of working groups to discuss the discrepencies and complementarities of different perspectives. 	1997	1997268:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	6	0.047619048	0.047619048	0.158730159	0.047619048	0.047619048	0.412698413	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.031746032	0.015873016	0.047619048	0.047619048	0.015873016	0.015873016	0	0.031746032	0	0	0.047058824	0	0	0	0	0	0.023529412	0	0.376470588	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.023529412	0.047058824	0.047058824	0	0	0	0	0.023529412	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0.035294118	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0.105882353	0	0.035294118	0.011764706	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035294118	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0.035294118	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.023529412	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4800	" ;Loik, Michael; "	PrecipNet: Analysis and synthesis of precipitation and ecosystem change	 The goal of the NCEAS PrecipNet Group is to analyze and synthesize results of the effects of climate change on ecosystems.

My goal is to gain understanding of the factors that limit tree ranges in neotropical forests both at local scales (hundreds of meters across topographic or moisture gradients) and regional scales (hundreds of kilometers across climatic gradients). I have assembled extensive and precise datasets from tree plots at both scales in Panama and Ecuador and I will develop novel population models that describe key biological processes: dispersal reproduction and survival of individual trees across habitats. The simulations offer predictions on spatial patterns of individuals relative to topography and habitat and these will be compared with observed spatial patterns to determine which population processes best account for the data.

Understanding the processes limiting ranges at local and regional scales is necessary to accurately predict future impact of deforestation and climate change. 	2005	2008399:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	65	6	0.029411765	0.029411765	0.117647059	0.088235294	0.117647059	0.205882353	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0.058823529	0.029411765	0.088235294	0	0.088235294	0	0.088235294	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.074626866	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0.119402985	0	0.059701493	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.059701493	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.044776119	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.089552239	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0.014925373	0.23880597	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0.044776119	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10241	" ;Hampton, Stephanie; Moore, Marianne; Zilov, Evgeny; "	The 60 year data set of plankton dynamics in Lake Baikal: Examining facets of the jewel of Siberia	 This international working group will use time series analysis to analyze a 60 year data set describing the plankton community of Lake Baikal (Siberia) the deepest oldest and most biotically diverse lake on the planet. Due to financial constraints on scientific research in Russia during the post Soviet era an extraordinary data set describing the dynamics of the plankton community in Lake Baikal has been greatly underutilized and it is nearly unknown by the international scientific community.

Our next meeting (the 4th overall proposed for January 2007) would focus on Activity 6 above: 1) Conducting and interpreting initial meta analyses 2) modifying aspects of the data base to facilitate further analyses and 3) adding more data in areas of weakness in the database. That meeting would also allow follow up work on the three outstanding manuscripts we will have at that point (from Activities 2 5 above) as needed. Specifically the goal would be to generate a draft of the manuscript from Activity 5 and to finish revisions of the manuscripts from Activities 3 and 4 if needed. The final two meetings (October 2007 and January 2008) would then be focused on final meta analyses and writing manuscripts from those (Activity 6) including papers for scientific audiences and also for practitioners of mycorrhizal management and on finishing the manuscript from Activity 5. Throughout the next three meetings we would also appreciate the opportunity to work with the staff at NCEAS to adapt our database model into a more general format and to tailor the Engauge digitizer program as described above. 	2007	2007460:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	24	6	0.102564103	0.025641026	0.076923077	0.025641026	0	0.128205128	0	0.076923077	0.076923077	0.102564103	0.051282051	0.051282051	0.051282051	0.025641026	0.076923077	0.128205128	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0.014705882	0.044117647	0.029411765	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.264705882	0.029411765	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0.058823529	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.029411765	0.088235294	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.088235294	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12064	" ;Atkinson, David; "	Towards a new metabolic theory of ecology	 The hugely influential Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) has been called ecologys big hot idea .

Including population dynamics enables addressing the distribution implications of physiological adaptation (both plastic and evolutionary) species interactions and dispersal limitations. I propose to first generalize an energetic optimization model across foraging strategies for ectothermic vertebrates. I will then examine current geographic trait variation for North American lizards to understand the potential for adaptation to moderate climate induced range shifts. This analysis will enable using performance optimization models and genetic models of thermal evolution to predict potential thermal adaptation following climate change.

An October 1998 Working Group of public land law and public administration theorists would be convened at NCEAS to explore protocols for policy setting in national parks that are legally and politically appropriate in the context of the emerging paradigm for policy setting on other public lands and the unique public land status of national parks. A November 1998 Working Group of theorists on the role of science in policy would be convened at NCEAS to explore the sociological influences affecting inferences from scientific evidence on the elk effects. The final product would be a book synthesizing the results of all 4 components or one publication each on the ecological synthesis and the policy aspects. 	1998	1999503:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0.018518519	0.074074074	0.148148148	0	0.018518519	0.277777778	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.037037037	0.203703704	0.055555556	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.055555556	0	0	0.185185185	0	0.037037037	0	0.12962963	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.037037037	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0.018518519	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0.037037037	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.148148148	0.018518519	0.074074074	0	0.018518519	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12182	" ;Randerson, James; Canadell, Josep; Jackson, Robert; "	Linking carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems with other climate forcing agents: A synthesis allowing for effective carbon dioxide stabilization policies	 Reforestation afforestation and avoided deforestation mitigation options influence climate at local to global scales by mechanisms in addition to their effect on stabilizing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. In some cases for example climate forcing from concurrent changes in albedo evapotranspiration and aerosols may have a larger impact regionally and globally than the net effects of greenhouse gases yet these mechanisms are not accounted for in current policy frameworks such as the Kyoto Protocol. We propose a series of three meetings bringing together ecosystem ecologists climate scientists and policy experts to synthesize recent work on tradeoffs between biogeochemical and biophysical forcing agents associated with land cover change. In a second step we plan to draft a policy perspective that reevaluates the role of terrestrial ecosystems in climate policy. 	2008	2010513:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	29	6	0.052631579	0.210526316	0.122807018	0.052631579	0.035087719	0.263157895	0.035087719	0.105263158	0	0.035087719	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.070175439	0.016129032	0	0.129032258	0.016129032	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.016129032	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.064516129	0	0	0	0.322580645	0	0	0.016129032	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.048387097	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.064516129	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.032258065	0	0	0	0	0.048387097	0.048387097	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12203	" ;Peterman, Randall; "	Monitoring responses of Pacific salmon to climate change	 This working group will develop monitoring programs that can identify changes in populations of Pacific salmon and attribute those changes to different potential mechanisms including climatic change. Analyses of data from such programs will (1) document changes in salmon populations (2) provide empirical data to compare with previous predictions (3)inform evaluation of alternative hypotheses about mechanisms by which climate change affects salmon and (4) inform suggested actions to maintain wild Pacific salmon populations over the long term. The group will develop guidelines for identifying an appropriate monitoring design given both budget constraints and location specific concerns about the response of Pacific salmon to climate change.

The reason for such global scale trends is still unknown. Ecological mechanisms operate locally and therefore appear inadequate to explain why these patterns are strongest at the largest geographic scales. Our goal is to test a novel evolutionary historical hypothesis the climatic   niche conservatism   hypothesis which postulates that more species inhabit more productive or warmer environments because most higher taxa originated in such environments and evolutionary constraints limit occupancy of colder or more arid regions. This hypothesis yields the testable prediction that ancestral climate state accounts for the strength of productivity or temperature richness relationships among taxa. We will test this using newly developed phylogenetic methods on both terrestrial and marine data. We will also quantify the timescales over which niche conservatism operates analyze historical climate richness data and investigate possible mechanisms for niche conservatism. 	2008	2009528:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0.033898305	0.033898305	0.101694915	0.152542373	0.06779661	0.305084746	0.06779661	0	0.084745763	0	0.101694915	0.016949153	0.016949153	0	0.016949153	0	0	0.014705882	0.264705882	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.044117647	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044117647	0	0	0	0	0.044117647	0.014705882	0	0	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.044117647	0	0	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0.073529412	0	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0.029411765	0	0	0	0.014705882	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12292	" ;Beechie, Timothy; Ruckelshaus, Mary; "	Resilience of Pacific salmon to climate change	 This working group aims to classify populations or metapopulations of Pacific salmon along a gradient of sensitivity or resilience to climate change.

With ranges from California to Alaska salmon species in the NE Pacific encompass a fairly diverse set of strategies for meeting the variety of challenges to survival posed during the stream and ocean phases of life history. Both climate and anthropogenic changes to riverine and ocean habitat are likely to influence this risk landscape. Optimal growth rates timing of emergence smoltification return from the ocean and spawning and other behaviors could be altered by warming stream temperatures changes in ocean upwelling patterns installation of river obstructions or transformation of rivers into lake environments by dams. In addition simple changes in environmental variables may drive complex population effects due to interspecies competition predation and disease dynamics.

Climate controls fish metabolic rates influences habitat use and regulates behavioral responses to a variety of environmental stimuli. For this reason climate change shapes not only fish distribution patterns but fish community composition because it influences the differential survival and reproduction of species across watersheds.

Research primarily has examined these community shifts in light of individual species environmental tolerances and interspecific interactions. However changes to dynamic links between spatially or temporally linked food webs may also be critical to understanding community scale responses to climate change. Across systems winter food webs under ice or snow can provide key trophic links to the food webs of warmer months usually supplying critical basal resources early in the warm season. For example in alpine communities complex under snow soil food webs develop then degrade with snow melt providing a critical pulse of nutrients to the summer plant communities. In marine Antarctic systems under ice phytoplankton provide an important base to the pelagic web. Such critical links may be disrupted with climate change as winter food webs have less time to develop and spring assemblages establish increasingly earlier. Using several long term year round plankton community datasets I will study how climate may alter dynamic cross seasonal links in freshwater food webs. Datasets include that maintained by Lyubov Izmesteva (Irkutsk State University Russia) for Lake Baikal the worlds largest lake located in subarctic Siberia. In Lake Baikal under ice development of diatoms provides a critical resource base to the benthic food web and potentially the pelagic ice free food web in subsequent months. I will examine how these dynamic spatial and temporal links have changed with the onset of shorter winters and earlier springs in the 60 years of data for Lake Baikal and in other freshwater systems with longer ice free seasons. In addition to providing basic ecological knowledge on how spatially and temporally coupled food webs may influence trophic structure and stability this research may allow us to predict ecological responses to changing climate at the level of the food web in addition to that of the species. 	2009	2010569:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	6	0.008849558	0.008849558	0.115044248	0.008849558	0	0.300884956	0.008849558	0.017699115	0	0.203539823	0.008849558	0.017699115	0	0.008849558	0.274336283	0.017699115	0	0	0.034188034	0	0	0	0.153846154	0.025641026	0.008547009	0	0.025641026	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0	0.017094017	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017094017	0.008547009	0	0.076923077	0.017094017	0.017094017	0	0	0	0.042735043	0	0	0.017094017	0	0.008547009	0.034188034	0	0	0	0.017094017	0.008547009	0.008547009	0.017094017	0.008547009	0	0	0	0	0	0.008547009	0	0.017094017	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0.273504274	0.008547009	0	0	0	0.008547009	0	0	0.008547009	0	0.05982906	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12428	" ;Mack, Michelle; "	Climate warming and fire in a nave biome: Using insights from boreal forest to understand causes and consequences of fire intensification in arctic tundra	 Human caused warming of climate at high northern latitudes appears to be increasing the intensity frequency and size of wildfires in boreal and arctic tundra biomes. Because  40 PeRcEnT of the worlds biological carbon stocks reside in these biomes intensification of fire could be a strong positive feedback to climate warming. Although fire has been part of the natural disturbance regime in many regions of the boreal forest arctic tundra has experienced relatively little fire disturbance in the Holocene. Intensification of fire in arctic tundra represents the introduction of a novel disturbance regime that could reshape the structure and function of arctic ecosystems. The goal of my proposed sabbatical research is to synthesize data from my lab and others to examine controls over an important aspect of fire intensificationfire severityand identify its consequences for ecosystem structure and function in both boreal and arctic Alaska. I propose to use statistical modeling techniques to address the following questions: (1) What are the important environmental and structural predictors of fire severity at the landscape scale? (2) What are the consequences of fire severity for emissions of C and N residual ecosystem C and N pools organic layer thickness and mineral soil exposure? (3) How do controls over and consequences of fire severity differ between boreal forest and a na ve biome arctic tundra? Anticipated products include a publicly available dataset a peer reviewed manuscript and a workbook for land and fire managers that provides step by step instructions for quantifying belowground fire severity in boreal forest and arctic tundra. This research will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of fire severity in high northern latitude systems important for predicting the net feedback of terrestrial ecosystems to a warming climate. 	2009	2010571:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0	0.017391304	0.034782609	0.026086957	0.069565217	0.52173913	0.052173913	0.052173913	0.008695652	0.034782609	0.034782609	0.008695652	0.008695652	0.113043478	0.008695652	0.008695652	0	0	0.294964029	0	0	0	0.021582734	0.007194245	0	0.007194245	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.064748201	0	0	0.014388489	0	0	0	0	0.014388489	0	0	0.007194245	0	0	0.007194245	0.007194245	0.007194245	0.043165468	0	0.007194245	0.09352518	0	0.050359712	0	0	0	0	0	0.021582734	0	0	0.064748201	0	0.043165468	0.007194245	0.007194245	0	0.035971223	0.007194245	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028776978	0	0	0	0	0.007194245	0	0.007194245	0.007194245	0	0.007194245	0.014388489	0	0	0.021582734	0.014388489	0	0.014388489	0	0	0.043165468	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12438	" ;Oberbauer, Steven; Troxler, Tiffany; "	Long term phenological changes in tundra plants in response to experimental warming and observed changes in climate	 Arctic regions are predicted to undergo strong warming in coming decades and they have already undergone measurable warming within recent decades. A coordinated international experiment on the effects of warming on the phenology and growth of individual tundra species and on plant communities the International Tundra Experiment (ITEX) started in 1990 to directly measure the ways in which tundra plants and communities respond to consistent lowlevel increases in temperature across the tundra biome. Tundra systems are clearly capable of responding to climate warming on fairly short time scales without artificial increases in nutrients and these changes will have significant impacts regionally and globally. One aspect of tundra plants that is highly sensitive to slight changes in temperature is phenology the timing of key life history events such as bud burst leaf growth flowering etc. The species phenology growth and community data analyzed to date show responses that in many ways mirror patterns seen along climate gradients but changes are too subtle and too variable to be detected by most individual site studies some after more than a decade of warming. ITEX as an observing network provides a unique opportunity to evaluate plant phenology changes at a global scale across the tundra biome. In this working group we will evaluate changes in plant phenology across the tundra biome over the past 10 15 years in two ways: 1) controls plots versus plots subject to long term experimental warming and 2) phenology of controls measured during the mid 1990s with controls remeasured during the recent International Polar Year field season. The primary request of this working group proposal is for access to facilities and expertise at NCEAS as we can provide much of the support for participants. 	2009	2009593:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	67	6	0	0	0.089285714	0.053571429	0.017857143	0.535714286	0.089285714	0.017857143	0.035714286	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0.032608696	0	0.152173913	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0.032608696	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0.02173913	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.184782609	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0.217391304	0	0	0.010869565	0	0	0	0	0.010869565	0.010869565	0	0	0.02173913	0.010869565	0.010869565	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0.032608696					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12477	" ;Pau, Stephanie; "	Improving our understanding of the ecological controls on the distribution and phenology of C3 and C4 grasses in response to climate variations	 This proposed project seeks to analyze and synthesize herbarium climate and satellite data over several decades to address the spatial and temporal response of C3 and C4 grasses to climate variability in the Hawaiian Islands. Complicating our understanding of C3 and C4 response to climate change and increased CO2 are large uncertainties regarding their differential response to climate variability. Numerous studies have demonstrated ecological sorting of C3 and C4 grasses along static spatial climate gradients though few studies have focused on phenological differences between C3 and C4 grasses. In Hawaii C4 grasses initiate a grass fire feedback cycle that directly affects ecosystem structure and function. El Ni o driven droughts the greatest source of interannual climate variability in Hawaii may contribute to this feedback by providing a tipping point for C4 grass invasion into new regions. Results from this project will provide new information on the functional significance of C4 photosynthesis and the invasion dynamics of C4 grasses.

Throughout their annual cycle monarchs utilize habitats in three different countries and require strikingly different resources and habitats at each life stage. Like other migratory animals this shifting spatial distribution poses challenges for identifying key determinants of monarch population dynamics and assessing their conservation status. Monarchs are an incredibly popular insect that has been exceptionally well studied; multiple long term monitoring programs exist within North America that span timescales of 3 to over 30 years. This virtually unprecedented wealth of data on a single animal species represents a rare scientific resource for understanding how natural and anthropogenic factors affect the population dynamics and movement patterns of migratory species. At the same time a great need exists to integrate existing data sets for analysis and interpretation of both within season and longerterm population trends. Our proposed working group includes a team of experts in monarch ecology migration biology statistical model building climate modeling and geography to answer the most fundamental questions of monarch biology throughout their range in North America. We will explore data from throughout the monarchs annual life cycle to identify major ecological mechanisms that shape large scale patterns of abundance and movement and to predict the consequences of human activities including shifting agricultural practices deforestation and climate change for long term dynamics. We will also work directly with NCEAS informatics staff to develop a web based portal that allows public access to and use of monarch butterfly observational data much of which has been collected by volunteer observers. Although our efforts focus primarily on a single species our questions approaches and findings will have great relevance to understanding the dynamics of other pollinator species and neotropical migrants across North America. 	2010	2011610:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	11	6	0.134146341	0.048780488	0.012195122	0.012195122	0.036585366	0.402439024	0	0.073170732	0.024390244	0.12195122	0	0.06097561	0	0.036585366	0.024390244	0.012195122	0.078947368	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.201754386	0	0	0.052631579	0.00877193	0	0	0.026315789	0.043859649	0	0.00877193	0	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.00877193	0	0	0	0	0.00877193	0.026315789	0.01754386	0.052631579	0.01754386	0	0.00877193	0	0.00877193	0.157894737	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.00877193	0.00877193	0	0.00877193	0	0.026315789	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.00877193	0.026315789	0.00877193	0.00877193	0	0.035087719	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12551	" ;Carbone, Mariah; "	A synthesis of soil respiration in semi arid and arid ecosystems across multiple spatial and temporal scales	 Soil respiration (SR) represents a huge uncertainty in global climate models. This is because we lack a mechanistic understanding of the plant and microbial processes that drive SR rates across different landscapes and in time. Predicting SR in semi arid arid ecosystems is particularly challenging because of high interannual variability in precipitation rapid wetting and drying cycles large temperature variations and short phenological cycles. By conducting a multiple phase synthesis of existing continuous SR datasets that span a range of semi arid arid ecosystem types this work will improve our basic understanding of the mechanistic controls on SR in these ecosystems. Semi arid arid ecosystems cover large areas of Earth and compared to tropical temperate and boreal ecosystems information about them is currently lacking in global synthesis studies. Specifically this research will identify key biotic and abiotic drivers of SR in these ecosystems and quantify their relative importance in a clear spatial and temporal framework. This will be accomplished through a combination of basic statistical and time series data analyses novel isotopic techniques as well as innovative model data integration approaches. Results will be used to: (1) improve parameterization and mechanistic representation of SR in models; (2) develop protocols and strategies for quantifying SR in and across semi arid arid ecosystems; (3) create a uniform and publically accessible SR database with original and derived data products including characterization of data uncertainties; and (4) contribute more broadly to a global SR synthesis effort. 	2011	2013616:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0	0	0.090909091	0	0.196969697	0.287878788	0.015151515	0.03030303	0.060606061	0.015151515	0.045454545	0.075757576	0.060606061	0.045454545	0	0.075757576	0	0	0.215909091	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.147727273	0.113636364	0.022727273	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0.034090909	0	0.011363636	0.068181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.056818182	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0	0.022727273	0.011363636	0.034090909	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0.022727273	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.011363636					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12574	" ;Cook, Benjamin; Wolkovich, Elizabeth; "	 Forecasting phenology: Integrating ecology climatology and phylogeny to understand plant responses to climate change 	 The magnitude and direction of plant species responses to climate change has widespread consequences for trophic interactions ecosystem services and our ability to predict the shape of future communities. To date however research has focused primarily on documenting species responses without developing a detailed understanding of why some species and communities vary with climate and others do not. Combining expertise from ecologists phylogeneticists and climatologists we will use extensive plant phenology data from experimental and observational studies across North America and Europe to conduct a metaanalysis and develop robust predictors of plant phenology responses and sensitivities to climate change. Our resulting database of phenological studies their related climate variables and phylogenetic trees will be we believe the most comprehensive data available to study the relationship between climate change and plant species phenological responses. Our comparison of experiments to observational studies will test whether short term small scale manipulations of climate can predict the long term trends seen on global scales and should improve the design of future climate manipulation experiments. Additionally our work will develop new approaches for the use of climate metrics in ecology and inform the designs of government data inventories and citizen science projects. 	2010	2012655:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	9	6	0.042372881	0.033898305	0.033898305	0.152542373	0.084745763	0.355932203	0.016949153	0	0.06779661	0.033898305	0.06779661	0.025423729	0.025423729	0.025423729	0.033898305	0	0	0.006896552	0.124137931	0.006896552	0	0.006896552	0	0	0.15862069	0.006896552	0.04137931	0	0.013793103	0.006896552	0	0	0	0.048275862	0.04137931	0.055172414	0	0.013793103	0.006896552	0.006896552	0	0.006896552	0.006896552	0.006896552	0.013793103	0	0.013793103	0	0	0.006896552	0	0	0.006896552	0.027586207	0.006896552	0.006896552	0	0	0	0	0.006896552	0.006896552	0.006896552	0	0	0.151724138	0.006896552	0	0	0	0.013793103	0	0.006896552	0	0.013793103	0	0	0.006896552	0.020689655	0.020689655	0.013793103	0	0.013793103	0	0	0.020689655	0	0.013793103	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.006896552	0	0	0	0.013793103	0	0.006896552	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12660	" ;Novak, Mark; Byrnes, Jarrett; Connell, Sean; "	Global impacts of climate change on kelp forest ecosystems	 We propose a working group to examine the global impact of climate change on kelp forest ecosystems. Kelp forests are temperate and boreal rocky reefs dominated by macroalgae from the order Laminariales. Kelps currently dominate temperate near shore ecosystems covering 25 PeRcEnT of the worlds coastline (Steneck  2002 Cavanaugh Unpublished Data). They are critically important species forming the foundation of many temperate and boreal coastal ecosystems(Dayton 1985). Anticipated change to kelps and their associated communities could have a large impact on the goods and services they provide. While individual impacts of extreme climate events have been explored at the regional or subregional level by many groups around the world(Scheibling and Lauzon Guay 2010) we currently a unified global understanding of how the slower longer term environmental shifts from climate change will alter kelp forest communities globally. Furthermore our current knowledge is often limited to kelps alone or kelps and a few key grazers. Our working group will fill these gaps to provide a synthetic picture of how climate change will alter the future of kelp forests. Our efforts will thereby jump start a growing global network of kelp forest researchers (50 and growing) to better coordinate efforts to forecast climate changes effects on kelp forests. Towards that end we propose three activities: 1) We will identify relevant abiotic impacts of climate change in each major kelp dominated biogeographic region. We will then perform a meta analysis of experimental and observational studies to examine the impact of predicted abiotic changes on kelps other dominant space holders herbivores and predators. 2) We will create a unified global database of all extant kelp community monitoring data sets. We will use these to model the direct and indirect impacts of changes in climate on community structure and function and highlight local deviations from global trends. 3) We will create a global database of species interaction networks for all kelp dominated regions. We will use results from our meta analysis and detection of global trends to examine how extinctions invasions and more subtle changes in the abundance of different species or guilds of species will alter future network structures. 	2013	2013659:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	6	0.08	0	0.03	0.01	0.04	0.42	0.01	0.04	0.05	0	0.22	0.01	0.06	0	0.01	0.02	0	0	0.17037037	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02962963	0.022222222	0	0.007407407	0.103703704	0.044444444	0	0.014814815	0.044444444	0.037037037	0	0	0.037037037	0.014814815	0.074074074	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0	0.007407407	0.007407407	0	0.014814815	0	0.125925926	0	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.007407407	0.014814815	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0.044444444	0.014814815	0.014814815	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0.044444444	0.007407407	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0.007407407	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0.014814815	0.014814815	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0.007407407					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12664	" ;Greig, Hamish; O'Connor, Mary; "	Synthesizing theory and databases to advance a general framework for how warming affects trophic interactions	 Environmental changes affect species by changing their physiology and thus activity rates and population growth rates. These rate changes affect trophic interactions among members of the community. Such higher order indirect effects are notoriously difficult to predict leading to great uncertainty about how species abundance food web structure and ecosystem function will respond to a changing climate. We will combine ecological theory such as the Metabolic Theory of Ecology (MTE) and its descendants with available databases to test predictions about how temperature affects species and their trophic interactions. First we will test whether optimal performance temperatures correspond to mean environmental temperatures or instead to a timeaverage of the physiological response that incorporates variance in temperature and second whether thermal sensitivity varies with body size. We will develop theoretical models to predict how these two possibilities alter species interactions and test these predictions using published data as well as empirical data from working group participants and results of warming experiments and observational studies. Our framework will help predict the response of food webs to warming across a range of habitats which is critical for national and global efforts to understand how atmospheric changes affect biodiversity and ecosystem function. We will develop this framework by achieving three goals: 1) We will use key principles of physiological responses to temperature change to derive theoretical predictions for the sensitivity of individuals to warming based on body size and thermal tolerance traits and then test these against data. 2) We will develop general theory to relate the effects of warming on individual performance to the strength and outcome of trophic interactions. 3) We will synthesize recent experiments that have warmed multi trophic communities to test theory and revise our central principles and questions This project builds on work begun in June 2012 in a Canadian Institute for Ecology and Evolution (CIEE) funded working group. However our CIEE funding is limited and we cannot continue without additional support.

The deep theoretical bases for the organization of landscapes and the ecological systems they support have yet to be articulated despite nearly two decades of research in this area. As a center fellow I plan to write a book entitled   Theoretical Landscape Ecology  . The book will enable ecologists to understand and apply insights from recent work in condensed matter physics where profound theories and theory generating tools have been developed to a high degree. Beginning with an exposition about scaling laws the book will include renormalization group theory (with applications to diffusion habitat use and disturbance) a theory of ecotones based on percolation phase transitions application of computation theory to landscape dynamics and new theory of energy supply as a control on biodiversity. My ongoing collaboration with Frank Davis via the Multiscale Assessment of the Columbia River Basin (CRB) project (P.

Each individual occupies a particular locality at a particular point in time. All interact most strongly with those individuals that are close by. It is our overall goal to assemble a group of researchers to explore the effects of this fundamental aspect of organism and environment. There have been many major recent advances in our understanding of how spatially explicit processes influence the dynamics of individual species and the structure dynamics and diversity of ecological communities. These advances have exposed the limitations of traditional non spatial approaches and uncovered a rich array of unexpected phenomenon that seemingly occur only when space is considered explicitly. For instance we now know that neighborhood interactions and local dispersal can lead to clustering even in physically homogeneous habitats. We also know that a combination of nonlinear local dynamics and larger scale dispersal can produce in predator prey systems a remarkable variety of spatial patterns such as spiral waves of predator and prey sweeping through a habitat spatial chaos or even a crystal like lattice of predator and prey. From a different theoretical perspective we have learned that dispersal (in a sufficiently large spatial arena) can stabilize predator prey and host parasite interactions that are unstable in small or homogeneous habitats. Likewise a new solution to the Prisoners Dilemma was discovered when it was solved in an explicitly spatial setting. Interestingly theory also suggests that many of these spatial effects may be captured with   pseudo spatial   models in which location or distance are not explicitly represented but instead space is thought of in terms of equally accessible patches that are either occupied or vacant  metapopulation models). While these   patch occupancy models   are appealing for their simplicity it is not generally known when they are appropriate simplifications. Thus one fundamental question regarding spatial ecology concerns how modelers should go about representing space. Is it necessary to consider the explicit spatial location of all individuals? Or are cellular automata reasonable approximations? Or might metapopulation like pseudospatial models suffice? Are there added insights and what are these insights that come from increasingly realistic considerations of space? Simple models such as metapopulation models are often analytically tractable because of their assumption of global dispersal. In contrast the more realistic reaction diffusion and other partial differential equation models are tractable only for cases that are often too simple to be of great ecological interest. Cellular automata models and more spatially complex explicit computer simulations have much greater ecological reality but suffer from the difficulty of generalization. Such issues need to be addressed via comparison and synthesis of these different approaches to space a task best completed by gathering together researchers with expertise in these different areas for extended discussion analysis and collaboration.In addition to theoretical questions regarding models of ecological dynamics in space there is an equally challenging set of questions faced by field researchers and experimentalists. Theory is of greatest use when it informs how we view nature and especially when there is an interaction between theory field observations and experimental tests of alternative hypotheses. Thus another area in need of major advances is the formulation of practical testable predictions and the need for field observations and experiments that can guide the development of new theories. Thus we seek not just a gathering of modelers but formation of a group of theoreticians and of experimentalists who are capable of forcing pragmatic guidelines and suggestions out of the theoreticians. Among our immediate goals is an improved understanding of the spatial patterns that result from interactions in spatial habitats. To date there have been few attempts to study the spatial patterns of organisms in nature and the dynamics of these spatial patterns. The ability to better visualize both actual and theoretically predicted spatial patterns and spatial dynamics could prove important in integrating theory and nature.To accomplish our goals we propose the establishment of a working group on   Spatial Ecology: The Role of Space in Population Dynamics and Interspecific Interactions.   The first task facing this working group would be the synthesis and distillation of current knowledge into a tightly edited cohesive book that would be designed to lay out the major insights provided by spatial approaches the multitude of unanswered questions and the approaches that could be taken in field observational and experimental studies as well as in additional theory to address these issues. We seek a book that will inspire much additional research in this area a book more in the spirit of a   Princeton Monograph   than either a textbook or a symposium volume. In addition we would like this working group to continue to pursue this synthesis of theory observation and experimentation even after a book has been produced. We envision the composition of the working group to be somewhat fluid and have planned no further than our first two meetings.  	1996	1996164:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	40	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2289	" ;Murdoch, William; "	Spatio Temporal Conference		1996	1996168:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	41	7	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0	0	0.176470588	0.294117647	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0	0.029411765	0.147058824	0.147058824	0.029411765	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.136363636	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.113636364	0	0.090909091	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.022727273	0.159090909	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.113636364	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.045454545	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2293	" ;Clark, James; "	The Role of Dispersal in the Holocene Expansion of Trees	 We propose a workshop to integrate new interdisciplinary data sets and models to better understand how dispersal influences tree population responses to rapid environmental change.

So has our understanding of dispersal and its erects. However our understanding of how demography and dispersal interact to determine spatiotemporal population dynamics is relatively poor. Recent theoretical advances provide tools that can bridge this gap but because demographic and dispersal data are rarely presented together they have yet to be applied. We propose to remedy this by forming a working group of empirical ecologists who have (or might obtain) both demographic and dispersal data and theoreticians interested in demography and dispersal. We will thus bring together and analyze combinations of data that otherwise would not be combined and jump start the process of unifying the theory of demography and dispersal. 	2001	2002210:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	7	0.023809524	0.071428571	0.071428571	0.047619048	0	0	0.238095238	0.023809524	0.119047619	0.023809524	0.095238095	0.071428571	0.047619048	0.023809524	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0.017857143	0.035714286	0.107142857	0.089285714	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.035714286	0	0	0	0.196428571	0.017857143	0.071428571	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0	0.053571429	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0.053571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3281	" ;Wiens, John; "	A conceptual synthesis of landscape ecology	 Landscape ecology deals with the causes and consequences of spatial variation in ecological systems and with their scaling dynamics. Beyond this central theme however landscape ecology is distinguished by its diversity. It is a broadly interdisciplinary science that combines tradtional ecology with elements of geography land use planning resource management and similar applied humanistic disciplines. Partly because of this interdisciplinary emphasis landscape ecology is emerging as an important component of conservation efforts and resource management. The diversity of approaches that makes landscape ecology relevant exciting however can also lead to a lack of cohesion and eventual splintering in the absence of empirical rigor predictive theory and conceptual integration. My goal is to develop a conceptual synthesis of the varied threads of landscape ecology that will provide the foundation for predictive and the context for empirical studies. This synthesis will consolidate a large body of literature of course but more importantly it will emphasize the integration of evidence with ideas by blending together the approaches and ways of thinking that characterize landscape ecology in many parts of the world and relating these to issues in both basic and applied ecology. 	2000	200124:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	53	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2039	" ;Hosseini, Parviez; "	Complex Population Dynamics		NaN	NaN257:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	7	0.06779661	0	0.016949153	0	0.118644068	0.101694915	0.203389831	0.13559322	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.06779661	0.101694915	0.101694915	0.033898305	0	0	0	0.0375	0.0875	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0125	0	0	0	0.0125	0	0.075	0.1125	0.025	0	0.05	0	0	0.05	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0125	0	0.0125	0	0	0	0	0.025	0.05	0.0375	0.0125	0.025	0.025	0	0	0.025	0.1	0	0	0	0.0125	0.0125	0	0.025	0	0.025	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.0125	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.05	0.0125	0	0	0.0375	0	0.025	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4540	" ;Venable, D.

There has also been some progress in scaling up temporally with recent developments of paleoecology palynology and tree ring research. However the relative difficulty of obtaining temporal data as compared to spatial data has slowed the rate of advance of temporal scaling. I have collected a 19 year data set on the population and community dynamics of a guild of Sonoran Desert annuals at the Desert Laboratory in Tucson Arizona. These data provide a valuable window on demographic variability in arid ecosystems that should be of interest to scientists studying climate vegetation interactions adaptations to variable environments and species coexistence in variable environments. I propose to spend my 12 month sabbatical at NCEAS to analyze this data and synthesize the results with respect to these three conceptual frameworks. While at NCEAS I intend to interact with other ecologists with long temporal data sets on population and community dynamics of desert organisms to explore the climate population community linkages in temporal dynamics. I also intend to interact with investigators interested in exploring the population dynamic functions shared by seed banks and other partially substitutable traits from an evolutionary ecological theoretical perspective and with investigators interest in temporal variance based species coexistence in desert annuals. 	2001	2002300:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	71	7	0.025	0.05	0.1	0.05	0.05	0	0.275	0.05	0.075	0.05	0.05	0.075	0.075	0	0.05	0.025	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0.057142857	0.057142857	0.028571429	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0.114285714	0	0	0	0	0.085714286	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.228571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0.057142857	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6460	" ;Knight, Tiffany; Morgan, Martin; Mazer, Susan; Ashman, Tia-Lynn; "	Beyond hand pollinations: Linking pollen limitation to plant population biology	 Pollen sufficiency is an important determinant of plant reproductive success and thus a major driver in plant ecology and evolution.

Many regions of Europe and eastern North America share broadly similar histories of land use over the past several centuries with varying degrees of forest fragmentation via clearance for agriculture and varying degrees of forest recovery on abandoned agricultural lands. Organisms in such fragmented and dynamic landscapes exist as metapopulations but metapopulation theory has only recently begun to incorporate dynamics of the landscape itself  habitat turnover). The most data friendly metapopulation model is the spatially realistic Incidence Function Model (IFM) of Hanski. Here I propose to develop modified versions of the IFM to incorporate habitat turnover and to use these as a theoretical framework in which to synthesize data on forest plant patch occupancy patterns in landscapes throughout Europe and eastern North America. Data from multiple landscapes will allow models parameterized for one landscape to be tested in others. This integration of models and data will allow metapopulation dynamics and persistence to be projected under a range of scenarios of future land use change. 	2004	2005349:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	7	0.014705882	0.029411765	0.058823529	0	0.147058824	0.088235294	0.279411765	0.029411765	0.088235294	0.029411765	0.029411765	0	0.073529412	0.029411765	0.058823529	0.044117647	0	0.011363636	0.034090909	0	0	0	0	0.056818182	0	0.090909091	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0.045454545	0.022727273	0.034090909	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.193181818	0	0.068181818	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0.011363636	0.011363636	0	0	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.011363636	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.056818182	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.022727273	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		8340	" ;Shachak, Moshe; "	The role of plants as landscape modulators in controlling biodiversity	 The issue of biodiversity has received increasing attention as a consequence of the unprecedented loss of species and their habitats in response to environmental changes. A central frontier topic in biodiversity studies concerns the factors controlling the flow of species from regional pools to local assemblages. My main assumption is that the filtering of species is determined to a large extent by a few major species that modify the landscape mosaic termed Landscape Modulators. I propose to compile ideas and data on the effects of different types of Landscape Modulators their spatial patterns and their filtering strength on various taxa of plants and animals. The aim of my work at NCEAS is to explore patterns based on literature review and on long term available data in order to develop a framework for a theory concerning the effect of organism induced landscape modulation on landscapes resources and organisms. My program aims for a synthesis of community and landscape ecology approaches. This study will advance the discipline of biodiversity by developing an approach to integrating species and landscape diversities through the activities of a few dominant modulators that control landscape functioning. This study will contribute to: (1) conservation restoration and management of landscape and species diversity; (2) predicting responses in terms of species richness to environmental changes (climate and land use) at different landscape scales; and (3) creation of a biodiversity management policy. 	2004	200535:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	45	7	0.153846154	0.030769231	0.138461538	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.015384615	0.369230769	0.030769231	0.030769231	0.015384615	0	0.015384615	0.030769231	0.030769231	0.015384615	0.092307692	0.03125	0.046875	0	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0.015625	0.09375	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0.046875	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0.0625	0.390625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.03125	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2057	" ;Sork, Victoria; "	Theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of gene flow in fragmented and managed populations	 Research in conservation biology and ecosystem management has been extended to an analysis of landscape effects on gene flow within and among plant populations. Theoretical models of gene flow stem from concepts developed by Sewall Wright that are based either on continuous populations using isolation by distance approach or on populations as islands that become differentiation through mutation and genetic drift. These models assume a null environment and populations of equal size. Recently theoretical developments in metapopulation analysis and landscape ecology as well as new empirical approaches in conservation genetics provide alternative and sometimes complementary approaches to the study of gene flow. The goals of the workshop would be: (1) to review the various theoretical and empirical approaches that either examine gene flow directly or can be modified to examine gene flow; (2) to review various software programs for these models; and (3) to compare the outcomes of these models using existing datasets.

I propose to develop models which borrow computationally efficient algorithms from circuit theory to bridge geographic and genetic data and predict effects of landscape pattern on genetic structuring in natural populations. 	2005	20083:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	45	7	0.105263158	0.043859649	0.131578947	0	0.00877193	0	0.429824561	0.00877193	0.105263158	0	0.00877193	0	0.043859649	0.087719298	0.00877193	0.01754386	0.037593985	0.007518797	0	0.007518797	0.022556391	0	0	0.022556391	0	0.030075188	0.015037594	0	0	0.030075188	0.007518797	0.007518797	0	0	0	0	0	0.007518797	0	0	0.060150376	0.007518797	0	0	0.052631579	0	0.015037594	0.030075188	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.007518797	0	0	0.112781955	0.293233083	0	0.037593985	0.037593985	0	0.037593985	0.007518797	0	0	0	0	0	0.045112782	0.007518797	0	0	0	0	0.015037594	0	0	0	0	0	0.015037594	0.007518797	0	0	0	0.007518797	0	0	0	0.007518797	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2005	" ;Sork, Victoria; "	 Synthesis of geographical spatial temporal and metapopulation models into the analysis of landscape level genetic data of woody plants  	 The study of genetic diversity is a key element to the fields of population conservation and evolutionary biology. Yet the analysis of genetic diversity of plants is often evaluated without reference to the geographical spatial temporal or metapopulation dynamics of the sampled populations. A major goal of my research program is to evaluate the extent to which the distribution of genetic variation within and among populations is influenced by environmental factors associated with the landscape where these populations occur. Using data from two separate research projects I propose to evaluate and integrate recent statistical approaches and models to construct a new synthetic approach that will allow the identification of environmental influences on the genetic structure of woody plant populations. By incorporating a multidimensional approach to the study of genetic diversity it is possible to develop more insight about the impact of selection gene flow and genetic drift on evolutionary dynamics of species. Such an approach will also allow more precise models about the factors which influence genetic diversity that can be used for the development of policies surrounding land and ecosystem management. The two projects which have generated the opportunity for developing such models both examine on the landscape level genetic diversity of woody plant species in Missouri and California respectively. The Missouri project has generated data on current genetic diversity mating system and progeny genetic diversity of several woody plant species distributed through the 5000 ha landscape. Because this study is part of a multi investigator project extensive data on the biotic and abiotic components of the Ozark ecosystem are available that are being incorporated into a Geographical Information System (GIS). The California project will generate preliminary data during the 1996 1997 year on gene flow hybridization and genetic structure of Englemann oak distributed in fragments located throughout southern California. This project also has access to GIS data including fragment size locations and shapes and Englemann oak densities that will allow me to evaluate the role of geographical and environmental variables in patterns of genetic variation.  	1997	1998415:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	44	7	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0	0	0	0.357142857	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0	0.214285714	0.071428571	0	0	0.071428571	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0.136363636	0	0.090909091	0.090909091	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.090909091	0.045454545	0	0.045454545	0	0.045454545	0.045454545	0	0	0.045454545	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10781	" ;Aizen, Marcelo; "	Effects of habitat fragmentation on pollination and reproduction: A synthesis through a meta analysis approach	 Dr. Marcelo Aizen a scholar from Argentina has received a Fulbright grant to investigate the effects of habitat fragmentation on pollination and reproduction.

My approach is both synthetic and interdisciplinary merging tools and concepts from different fields. My work is eminently collaborative (click here for a list of my collaborators). One major interest deals with the spatial dimension of population and community dynamics. For example I have studied how the coexistence of competitors and natural enemies is enhanced by spatial heterogeneity arising from the interaction between local dynamics and short range dispersal. I use novel approximations derived from my basic research to attempt to answer unresolved questions in conservation biology. For example how much habitat should be preserved or how many patches are necessary for the persistence of a metapopulation. My research yielded simple rules of thumb aimed at answering these kinds of questions. Another research interest focuses on networks of ecological interactions involving both food webs and plant animal coevolutionary networks (pollination and seed dispersal). My goal is twofold: to describe the structure of these networks and to relate this structure to their persistence and coevolution. 	2003	2006459:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	38	7	0.117647059	0.078431373	0.019607843	0.019607843	0.078431373	0.039215686	0.196078431	0.019607843	0.039215686	0.019607843	0.117647059	0	0.078431373	0.058823529	0.078431373	0.039215686	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.080645161	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0.032258065	0.016129032	0	0	0.032258065	0	0.048387097	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0.080645161	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.016129032	0	0.258064516	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.048387097	0.016129032	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0	0	0.032258065	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0	0.016129032	0	0	0.032258065	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.032258065	0	0.064516129	0.032258065	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12062	" ;Allesina, Stefano; "	Reverse engineering of ecological networks: From the disassembly to the construction of robust networks	 Molecular biologists study how a gene works in an organism by switching it off engineers try to replicate the functioning of a device by taking it apart and studying how its components are wired together archaeologists reconstruct ancient machinery by examining fragments buried for centuries: these are all examples of reverse engineering. This approach is usually precluded to ecologists given the potentially dramatic consequences of disturbing ecosystems except in mathematical models and in silico simulations of scenarios.

I will focus not only on predator prey interactions but also on other major constituents of ecological networks such as parasitism pollination and mutualism in a dynamic context with the ultimate goal of understanding how to assemble robust networks.

A theoretical framework aimed at understanding and predicting communities responses to these destructive processes is still lacking however. In this proposal I describe an integrative approach aimed at gaining better insight on the response of ecosystems to habitat destruction. It is based on an interaction between theoretical models and the analysis of patterns in real ecosystems using data bases. Spatially explicit models can be derived to account for the role of spatial structure on metapopulation abundance and species diversity. There are critical thresholds of destruction derived from percolation theory at which landscape structural properties and the subsequent metapopulation regional abundance change in a non linear way. This non linearity has important implications for conservation biology and landscape management. Some of these predictions can be tested using data bases. Information provided by the models can help to explain the patterns observed in real ecosystems. In turn such data is expect to improve the models.  	1998	2000548:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	45	7	0.107142857	0.071428571	0.047619048	0.011904762	0	0	0.488095238	0.023809524	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0.05952381	0.083333333	0.011904762	0	0.023809524	0.036363636	0.027272727	0	0.018181818	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0.009090909	0	0.027272727	0.009090909	0.009090909	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.118181818	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.109090909	0.027272727	0.009090909	0.018181818	0.163636364	0.218181818	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0.009090909	0	0	0	0	0.009090909	0.045454545	0	0	0.009090909	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12352	" ;Storfer, Andrew; Rosenberg, Michael; Epperson, Bryan; "	An interdisciplinary approach to advancing landscape genetics	 Landscape genetics is the intersection of landscape ecology with population genetics.

It is an intrinsic characteristic of freshwater stream environments where watersheds are nested within one another and sites are connected by stream flow through directed networks. Analyzing spatially correlated data requires the use of spatial statistical methodologies because the assumption of independence is violated making many conventional statistical methods inappropriate. Spatial statistical methods have only recently been developed that represent the unique spatial configuration longitudinal connectivity flow volume and flow direction found in freshwater ecosystems. These methods provide significant potential advancements for ecological research and aquatic monitoring because spatial statistical models can be used to quantify patterns of spatial autocorrelation across multiple scales to make predictions at unobserved sites with estimates of prediction uncertainty and yield unbiased regression parameter estimates relating ecological variables to the environment. Our proposed working group will extend the capabilities of spatial statistical models for stream networks to include additional functionality available in traditional spatial statistical methods so that a wider range of ecological and management questions can be fully addressed. To accomplish this goal we will: 1) identify the most pressing needs in terms of analytical capabilities  what would be most useful for informing science and management) and begin developing these models with possible extensions to include space time models generalized linear mixed models computing for massive datasets and others as identified by the working group 2) assess the current state of software and functionality and determine whether it is sufficient to meet those needs and develop new ones in conjunction with the previous objective and 3) intensely analyze a single nationally important large multivariate stream dataset collected across the Northwestern (NW) United States (US) to gain ecological insights evaluate methods and demonstrate the new spatial statistical modeling capabilities. 	2011	201169:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	5	7	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2107	" ;Hanski, Ilkka; "	Metapopulation models		1996	1996151:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	4	8	0.110091743	0	0.027522936	0.009174312	0.018348624	0	0.082568807	0.532110092	0.036697248	0.009174312	0.073394495	0.009174312	0.036697248	0.009174312	0.018348624	0.027522936	0	0	0	0.319148936	0	0.007092199	0.021276596	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.042553191	0.014184397	0	0.021276596	0.007092199	0	0.09929078	0.014184397	0.007092199	0	0.035460993	0.007092199	0.021276596	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.007092199	0.007092199	0.007092199	0	0	0.014184397	0	0	0.021276596	0.007092199	0.007092199	0.007092199	0.007092199	0.014184397	0	0.028368794	0	0.007092199	0.014184397	0	0.007092199	0	0	0.04964539	0.04964539	0.014184397	0	0.007092199	0	0.028368794	0	0.021276596	0	0	0	0	0	0.007092199	0	0	0.021276596	0	0	0.007092199	0	0	0	0	0	0.021276596					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2264	" ;Turchin, Peter;Murdoch, William; "	Complex Population Dynamics	 Population cycles and other complex population dynamics occur in a wide range of taxa and environments including temperate and tropical forest insects marine and freshwater fish and invertebrates and boreal mammals. Population cycles show enormous variation in amplitude (from less than one to five orders of magnitude) period (from a single generation to 30 50 generations) and the strength of periodicity (ranging from noisy pseudoperiodic or apparently chaotic oscillations to an almost perfect periodicity). In addition cycles may involve not only the total population abundance but also other aspects of dynamics oscillations in age structure and complex spatio temporal behaviors such as synchronous oscillations or periodic traveling waves.There are many potential explanations for oscillatory population dynamics (in the general sense) with some focusing on intrinsic factors but most often invoking some aspect of consumer resource interactions (we briefly review some theoretical and empirical mechanisms by which population cycles can arise). The theoretical literature on population cycles is enormous but there has been no attempt to systematize it and to relate various postulated mechanisms to the oscillatory patterns observed in real populations.Our long term goal is to bring order to what is known theoretically and empirically about population cycles. More specifically we propose to: define and classify the range of mechanisms that can induce oscillatory population behavior in theoretical models; establish correspondences between theoretical mechanisms that could drive cycles and quantitative descriptors of oscillatory population dynamics; apply a combination of modeling and statistical techniques to a number of data sets in an attempt to determine which of the possible theoretical mechanisms may be responsible for population oscillations in each particular case. attempt to develop general statements about mechanisms that are responsible for cycles in nature and the conditions under which different mechanisms may operate and different types of oscillatory dynamics may arise. Previous investigations of population oscillations have utilized primarily two distinct approaches: potential mechanisms have been investigated with mathematical models while data patterns have been investigated with phenomenological time series analyses (cycles have also been investigated experimentally but this approach is not part of our proposal because it falls outside of the scope of the research supported by the Center). We propose to bring together individuals representing both approaches to collaborate on a program in which theoretical model development and statistical analyses of data will be tightly linked. We hope to gain strong synergistic advantages from such a collaboration. 	1996	1998172:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	4	8	0.045454545	0.045454545	0.181818182	0.136363636	0	0	0.113636364	0.295454545	0.045454545	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0.02	0.12	0	0	0	0.1	0	0.02	0.02	0.04	0	0	0	0.04	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0.02	0.04	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0.04	0	0	0.08	0	0.02	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0.06	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.08	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2297	" ;Possingham, Hugh; Shea, Katriona; Mangel, Marc; "	Population Management	 Population management as a general problem has three main aspects: conservation harvesting and control. In the first a manager is interested in increasing the size of a population that is declining to extinction; in the second the aim is to maintain the size of a population of an exploited species at a productive level; and in the last to cause a decrease in the numbers of a pest. The common thread is the regulation of population size and growth rate under some management regime. Yet in spite of this these goals are often thought about as separate issues (as the proliferation of books on conservation and pest control and the relative inaccessibility of the fisheries management literature will testify). All three areas have developed relatively independently and have fairly strong theoretical constructs with conceptual and mathematical models. The differences are great enough that each has something to teach the other. However it seems that there are a great many commonalities and that the time is right for an examination of the shared theoretical underpinnings objectives and tools. This proposal which is for a synthesis as well as more specific cross field projects calls for a working group of approximately 12 people (including 5 6 students) representing the three areas of interest to spend four weeks at the NCEAS in July August of 1997 and for a small follow up group of 2 people a year later.  	1997	1997180:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	24	8	0	0.114285714	0	0.028571429	0.042857143	0.114285714	0.014285714	0.328571429	0.085714286	0.014285714	0.014285714	0.042857143	0.114285714	0.071428571	0	0.014285714	0.01	0	0	0	0.05	0	0.03	0.01	0.02	0.01	0	0.01	0	0	0.01	0	0	0.01	0.03	0	0.01	0	0	0.26	0	0	0.03	0	0	0.01	0	0.01	0.01	0.01	0	0.02	0	0	0	0.01	0.06	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0.03	0	0.07	0	0.01	0	0.01	0.02	0	0	0	0.07	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.03	0.01	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.01	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2460	" ;Brown, James; "	Allometry	 I propose to spend my next sabbatical leave due in the Fall Semester of 1999 at The National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS). The main reason for spending the sabbatical at NCEAS is that the center provides the best environment for the work I hope to accomplish. Foremost I want to continue my collaborative work on allometry with Geoffrey B. West a physicist at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) and the Santa Fe Institute (SFI) and Brian Enquist my recent Ph.D. student who has a NSF Postdoctoral Fellowship that he will spend largely at SFI. My unwillingness to interrupt this unique interdisciplinary collaboration leads me to spend my sabbatical at a place that can offer active support in part by providing a conducive place where Geoff and I can visit and we can work together for extended periods. Unfortunately Geoff cannot spend the entire period at NCEAS (the joint sabbatical model) because of his appointment at LANL and family commitments. I want to do two things while at NCEAS: 1) work with Geoff and Brian to carry our models of allometric scaling in biology to the next stage which involves applications of life history and evolution; and 2) collaborate with Geoff to write a book tentatively titled Scale of Life. Our research is advancing so rapidly that we are not sure just how much we will have been able to accomplish in the next year. It is important however that progress not be seriously interrupted as it would be if I went abroad for a sabbatical. We could advance more rapidly if Geoff and I could devote more time to our collaboration. Therefore I propose to spend the 4 months of my sabbatical (September 1 1999 to January 1 2000) at NCEAS and to bring Geoff in for two extended periods of one month each so that we can work together. Whatever the stage of our theoretical work we believe that we should be able to make much additional progress in periods of intensive collaboration in the conducive environment of NCEAS and Santa Barbara. It is also not clear where Brian will take his program in the next year or two. If additional collaboration with Geoff and me would be of mutual benefit however his NSF postdoctoral Fellowship will enable him to spend the necessary time at NCEAS. The first goal then is to advance our collaborative theoretical research as rapidly as possible. Initially we will focus on ecological and life history consequences of both. Eventually we hope to explain the central role of body size and allometric scaling in diversity. This is fundamental because living organisms range in size over an amazing amount of magnitude from 10 13 g microbes to 108 g whales and because species diversity is constrained by size: there are more kinds of beetles than elephants. As a second goal Geoff and I plan to start work on a book tentatively titled The Scale of Life. This would be a synthetic   essay   written for a wide audience of biologists and others with an interest in biology. In its level of approach and broad treatment it would be similar to Schmidt Nielsens (1984) classic book Scaling: Why Animal Size is so Important. However it would differ in several essential respects. First it would have much broader coverage with more underlying physical principles with plants as well as animals and with eco evolutionary as well as anatomical and physiological aspects of allometry. Second it uses our model as a common theoretical basis for exploring a wide variety of biological scale relationships. Finally it will presumable be able to offer a more synthetic treatment of myriad consequences of body size. 	1999	2000240:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	49	8	0.056910569	0.073170732	0.048780488	0.162601626	0	0.032520325	0.048780488	0.260162602	0.032520325	0.056910569	0	0	0.008130081	0.032520325	0.032520325	0.154471545	0	0	0	0.06557377	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.049180328	0	0	0.008196721	0	0	0	0.106557377	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0	0.008196721	0	0	0	0	0	0.008196721	0	0.032786885	0.008196721	0	0	0	0.040983607	0	0	0	0	0.090163934	0.008196721	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0	0.008196721	0.213114754	0.040983607	0.008196721	0	0.016393443	0	0	0.016393443	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.081967213	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0	0	0	0.008196721	0	0	0.016393443	0.016393443	0	0	0.008196721	0.008196721	0	0.016393443	0	0.016393443	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4020	" ;Gerber, Leah; "	Developing population models to examine mortality impacts and spatial components of sea otter demographics	 The Southern sea otter population has recovered from near extinction over the last 100 years. The slow recovery rate in California (5 PeRcEnT annually) compared to Alaskan populations (17 20 PeRcEnT) suggests that the southern population is highly vulnerable to emerging mortality problems  disease) and ecological disasters  oil spills). Over the last 3 5 years recovery of the southern sea otter population has ceased and abundance has declined. By 1999 the population declined approximately 12 PeRcEnT from its peak in 1995. This decline has been accompanied by in apparent increase in sea otter strandings and it is generally believed that mortality is the key factor regulating southern sea otters. Studies at the National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC) and California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) suggest that disease mortality patterns may have changed over the past 10 20 years and newly recognized diseases may pose a significant threat to sea otters. The goal of our working group is to develop demographic models to evaluate impacts of mortality on sea otter populations for both overall population growth as well as spatially explicit components. Modeling approaches will rely on a variety of data sources including abundance estimates mortality data and cause specific death information. We will use a maximum likelihood to evaluate changes in mortality for age and sex groups and estimates of probability of mortality through space and time will be used to evaluate the relative contribution of each mortality source to total mortality. This modeling will set the stage for future evaluation of 1) historical changes in mortality patterns 2) spatial relationships between disease and otter population and habitat distribution and 3) spatial relationships between disease mortality and sources of disease agents  sewage). 	2001	2001246:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	51	8	0	0.107142857	0.142857143	0	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0.285714286	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0.107142857	0.142857143	0	0.035714286	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.111111111	0.083333333	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0.111111111	0	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.166666667	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0.083333333	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4220	" ;Ashley, Mary; "	New analytical methods in molecular ecology	 From August 2001 to July 2002 I will be on sabbatical from position as Associate Professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

Seven of these species are extinct or threatened with extinction. These seven species all have a mean body mass of over 13 kilograms. Why do larger canids apparently face a higher extinction risk? This book will examine the role of body mass and ecology in the evolution of cooperative breeding in Family Canidae and the implications for population viability. Long term research on a medium sized canid jackals will provide data sets on kinship territory tenureship (survival) and relative reproductive success that allow graphic modeling of alternative reproductive tactics. These data will also allow estimates of population viability that include individual temporal and spatial variation. The book will then broaden its scope to examine the allometry of canid life history traits and the evolution of cooperative breeding. The final section of the book will search for patterns that examine how some canid species may be limited by their ecology and food resources and also constrained by their reproductive options. A model will be developed that incorporates body mass kinship demography and ecology to assess how these factors affect alternative canid reproductive tactics. Such a model has the potential to elucidate why larger canids experience higher risk of extinction. 	2001	2003269:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	51	8	0.1	0.066666667	0.083333333	0.016666667	0.066666667	0	0.016666667	0.333333333	0.016666667	0	0.033333333	0.033333333	0.15	0.05	0	0.033333333	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0.074626866	0.179104478	0.014925373	0	0.044776119	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0.044776119	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.28358209	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0.014925373	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4820	" ;Buston, Peter; "	The ecology of hermaphroditic breeding systems	 There is an enormous diversity of hermaphroditic breeding systems distributed throughout the plant and animal kingdoms. To gain a greater understanding of this diversity I propose to investigate the socio ecological factors that underlie the evolution of these systems. First I will develop new game theoretic models to generate explicit predictions about how ecological social and genetic factors combine to influence the distribution of reproduction within the breeding systems of both sequential and simultaneous hermaphrodites. Second I will synthesize the extensive but scattered empirical literature on plant and animal (vertebrate and invertebrate) hermaphroditic breeding systems gathering data on the socio ecological factors that theoretical models indicate might give rise to these systems.

They are also the closest living relatives of humans and therefore hold the keys to resolving many questions about human evolution and ecology. However the slow life histories of primates combined with their complex social systems their behavioral plasticity and the challenging field conditions in which primate researchers must work have severely limited analyses of mortality and fertility in wild unprovisioned primate populations. This in turn limits both conservation efforts and comparative analyses that can shed light on the population dynamics and the social and ecological adaptations that have shaped both human and nonhuman primate evolution. We propose a Primate Life Histories Working Group to compare mortality and fertility schedules across taxa and evaluate a set of hypotheses about the evolution of mortality and the relative importance to fitness of variation in fertility and survival rates. Using unique individual based life history data that have been collected from wild populations by eight working group participants over a minimum of 15 years we will develop age specific mortality and fertility schedules and create population projection matrices for each species. Our immediate goals are to test current hypotheses about the evolution of mortality lifespan and reproduction in order to advance our understanding of primate evolution. Our longer term goal is to move toward a collaborative shared databank housing irreplaceable life history data on primates. Many primate species are endangered or are under increasing anthropogenic pressure and compiling these data is important both for conservation efforts and for scientific archives. 	2009	2011466:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	52	8	0	0.105263158	0.035087719	0.035087719	0.052631579	0.01754386	0	0.473684211	0.052631579	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0.087719298	0.070175439	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0.013888889	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0.055555556	0	0	0	0.222222222	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.097222222	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12100	" ;Weiner, Jacob; "	The allometry of reproduction in plant populations	 Growth and reproduction are two of the most fundamental processes for plants. After a plant produces biomass it allocates this biomass to different structures and functions among them reproduction. Most allocation patterns can be better understood in terms of size than in terms of time so an allometric approach to allocation is needed. While there has been much recent research on broad allometric scaling relationships among species the allometry of reproduction within populations is a very different question which has not been given sufficient attention. The objective of the proposed research is to gather and analyze as much relevant data as possible on the allometry of reproductive allocation within plant populations to address the following questions: (1) Is there a general pattern of size dependent reproductive output within plant species? (2) Is there a tradeoff between the minimum size for reproduction and allocation to reproduction above that minimum size? (3) When are size fecundity relationships plastic and when is reproductive output solely a function of size and fixed allometric allocation patterns? These questions are fundamental to plant population ecology and evolution and for optimizing the use of resources in plant production systems. 	2007	2008547:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	51	8	0	0.066666667	0.011111111	0	0.111111111	0.022222222	0.011111111	0.4	0	0	0.022222222	0.044444444	0.155555556	0.088888889	0.022222222	0.044444444	0.009708738	0	0	0.067961165	0	0.029126214	0	0.009708738	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.009708738	0	0	0.009708738	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.155339806	0.009708738	0.009708738	0.029126214	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.009708738	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.019417476	0.019417476	0	0	0	0.339805825	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009708738	0.009708738	0	0	0	0.009708738	0	0.029126214	0.019417476	0	0	0	0	0	0.019417476	0	0.058252427	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.077669903	0.009708738	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12349	" ;Queenborough, Simon; "	Addressing a long standing paradox: How do dioecious plant species persist?	 Breeding system impacts on the ecology and evolution of coexisting plant species. Perhaps the best example of such impacts is exemplified by dioecious plant species (those with separate male and female individuals) populations of which suffer a fitness cost because of the lower number of seed bearing stems relative to ecologically similar hermaphroditic species. To maintain per capita growth rates that are equal to their hermaphroditic counterparts female individuals in dioecious populations must exhibit one or more fitness advantages which might include: higher fecundity higher rates of offspring recruitment earlier ages of reproduction more frequent reproduction or higher quality offspring. The fitness advantages predicted to have evolved in dioecious species have remained elusive because of inadequate data and a failure to fully integrate phylogeny and dynamic demographic and distribution data with other species functional traits. This study will use a newly developed functional trait database of plant reproductive traits and recently available rigorously collected spatially explicit plant demographic data on  6 000 species and  3 000 000 individuals to examine the associations among breeding systems demography and functional traits in a phylogenetically informed way in order to seek evidence for fitness advantages in dioecious taxa. 	2010	2011552:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	51	8	0.028985507	0.014492754	0.014492754	0	0.028985507	0.028985507	0.014492754	0.550724638	0.028985507	0	0.028985507	0.014492754	0.173913043	0.028985507	0.028985507	0.014492754	0	0	0	0.164705882	0	0	0	0.047058824	0.011764706	0	0	0	0.035294118	0.058823529	0	0.011764706	0.058823529	0.070588235	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.047058824	0	0.070588235	0	0.176470588	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0.011764706	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.023529412	0	0.023529412	0.082352941	0	0	0	0	0	0.011764706	0	0	0	0.035294118	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12360	" ;Williams, Jennifer; "	Evaluating life history theory and the consequences of reproductive strategy for population fluctuations	 Organisms have evolved a variety of mechanisms to maximize individual fitness in the face of environmental stochasticity that may also serve to buffer population fluctuations. Life history strategies for reproduction including whether to produce all offspring at once (semelparity) or to spread out the reproductive effort across several bouts (iteroparity) can lead to important consequences for population persistence. While much theory predicts which strategy should be optimal for individuals few empirical tests exist. The proposed research will use stochastic population models compiled from published and unpublished data of species that exhibit facultative semelparity to address two unresolved issues in evolutionary biology and population ecology: when can iteroparity buffer population fluctuations and do life history predictions match the observed strategy with realized levels of stochasticity? This project will help to refine current life history theory on semelparity and iteroparity and will clarify the connection between selection pressures on individuals and the consequences for population persistence. Understanding a mechanism that can buffer population fluctuations will also contribute to predictions of which species may be more vulnerable to increased climate variability.

Although natural selection is widespread and often strong much less is known about the immediate effects of selection on population dynamics. I propose a method that can be used to quantify the direct effects of trait variation and natural selection on population dynamics. This method will be applied to meta analyses examining the overall influence of selection on demographic components of fitness in a broad variety of organisms. Information from meta analyses will be combined with models of population dynamics to evaluate how trait variation and selection can affect key population attributes such as size growth rate and probability of extinction. This work will be further applied to develop conceptual models of how different modes of selection  directional stabilizing and disruptive) influence concurrent population dynamics.

While there has been an increase in the number of studies addressing the interface between behavior and conservation theory a paradigm for applying behavioral knowledge to real world conservation problems has not yet been developed. The goal of this research is to integrate theories from behavioral ecology with quantitative techniques in demography in order to examine the effects of a variety of reproductive behaviors on extinction risk. Trained as a population biologist most of my research to date has focused on the effects of density dependence environmental stochasticity and catastrophic mortality events on the viability of endangered populations. Recognizing that this coarse approach ignores the finer subtleties of animal behavior I seek to bridge the gap between behavioral ecology and population dynamics. This research will provide practitioners with guidelines for understanding when behavior should be an important component of a particular management strategy  can we identify behavioral cues of population dysfunction that provide cost effective monitoring alternatives?).

It is a critical determinant of extinction risks population viability and population regulation. I propose to study recruitment variability and its consequences on population dynamics from a combined empirical and theoretical perspective. In the project I will (1) bring together stochastic and density dependent theories of populations dynamics (2) develop statistical methodology dedicated to the study of abundance data (3) estimate the magnitude of recruitment variability through time series analysis and (4) quantify the effects of variability on population dynamics through stochastic simulation. I focus on regulation in populations that are governed by age or stage structured interactions. That is because many economically important populations that exhibit recruitment variability (such as fishery stocks) are governed by structured interactions. The dynamic effect of the variability will vary greatly depending on the relative and absolute strengths of the intra and inter stage interactions. In accomplishing the 4 objectives I will increase our understanding of the interaction between density dependent and density independent forces. I will quantify the importance of stochastic events in shaping the dynamics of real populations and improve on the analytical tools to deal with recruitment variability.

Deep sea benthic communities have now been sampled on local regional and global scales but by many independent programs that have different objectives use different methods and infer biogeographic patterns with different taxa or functional groups. Inevitably this led to a welter of explanations of diversity that seem quite contradictory. At local scales research has focused on how species coexistence can be mediated in an apparently homogeneous sediment environment. Precision sampling and manipulative experiments have provided convincing evidence that small scale patchiness permits a large number of similar invertebrates to coexist by specializing on different types of patches or different successional stages of a patch. This suggests that the mosaic nature of the deep sea and the stochastic processes tied to patch formation permit high local diversity. At larger scales however definite geographic patterns of diversity emerge that cannot be accounted for by simple stochastic patch dynamics. Bathymetric patterns of diversity have been attributed to environmental gradients of nutrient input and the relative intensity of biological interactions to geographic variation in sediment particle size heterogeneity and to large scale disturbance. At global scales there are latitudinal gradients of diversity and strong interregional differences that appear to be correlated with the pattern and rate of surface production. At these very large scales the evolutionary processes that ultimately generate regional species pools and the historical spread of the deep sea fauna must come into play as well. Species diversity in the deep sea as in other environments undoubtedly reflects an integration of ecological and evolutionary processes operating at different spatial and temporal scales. But because of the pace of discovery and independence of various research efforts pattern and scale have not been synthesized for deep sea communities. A critical discussion of this problem by experts working at different scales would contribute very significantly to reconciling theories of diversity and setting an agenda for future comparative and experimental research to test hypotheses on deep sea biodiversity.  	1996	1996176:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	10	9	0.133333333	0	0	0	0.133333333	0	0	0	0.4	0	0.066666667	0.133333333	0.066666667	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.130434783	0	0	0	0.217391304	0.043478261	0.043478261	0	0.043478261	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0.043478261	0.043478261	0.043478261	0	0.043478261	0	0.043478261	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.086956522	0	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2309	" ;Holt, Robert; "	The ecological and evolutionary dynamics of species borders	 All species are distributed in space but within limits.

First to compile a set of seminal research papers provide original commentary on their relevance and organise them into a book   The Foundations of Biogeography.   This book is to be published by the University of Chicago Press. Second to organise an international society of biogeography along with supporting activities such as the initiation of society meetings and the development of a web page. Third to develop and establish future working groups and workshops on biogeography. Rationale and Strategies: The field of biogeography has a long and distinguished history. In the past several decades it has experienced renewed interest with a greatly increased volume of work. It is therefore both timely and important that we develop a more thorough understanding of the foundations of this field including all of its subdisciplines. The compilation of a book on this subject should greatly facilitate this endeavour. To accomplish this we have invited a distinguished group of biogeographers and ecologists from a variety of geographic regions and subdisciplines to join us in this project. As much as any field the new biogeography that has emerged is interdisciplinary international and spans a broad range of spatial and temporal scales. To better foster interactions among the diverse group of scientists who do biogeography we believe it is important to establish an international society of biogeography. By bringing eminent biogeographers from diverse backgrounds and locations together we plan to do the initial work in establishing such a society. We also believe that there are a number of interesting and very important questions that can best be addressed by small groups of highly motivated and interactive biogeographers. By bringing biogeographers together for the first time we hope to stimulate the advancement of the field of biogeography and the many disciplines that interact and overlap with biogeography. 	2000	2001209:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	9	0.162790698	0	0.023255814	0	0.23255814	0	0	0	0.255813953	0.046511628	0.069767442	0.093023256	0.069767442	0.046511628	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.083333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.1875	0	0	0	0.020833333	0.145833333	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0.020833333	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0.020833333	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0.020833333	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0.041666667	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3260	" ;Shurin, Jonathan; "	Detecting species interactions in survey data: New approaches and applications	 Geographic variation in community structure can be driven by the physical environment biotic interactions stochastic factors such as colonization and disturbance history or by interactions among all three.

Despite the complexities that must be involved the   energy hypothesis   may provide a parsimonious explanation for much of the gradient. However there are a number of unresolved issues related to the energy hypothesis that need to be addressed including (1) the relationship between energy and other determinants of diversity and how to distinguish them (2) which of two versions of the energy hypothesis the   productivity hypothesis   or the   ambient energy hypothesis   may apply to different taxa (3) the relative roles of currently operating climatic factors and historical forces (4) the probability that different factors operate in different latitudinal zones. (5) possible scale dependence of energy diversity relationships and (6) the most appropriate statistical methodology for testing the hypothesis. The proposed working group will address these issues with the goal of providing a rigorous statement of what the energy hypothesis claims and providing a standardized format for the generation of data to test it. A further goal is to use the new format to generate a data base comprising all existing data related to the energy hypothesis. Finally we will analyze this database to determine the current state of the hypothesis and identify areas requiring additional research. Our general goal is to convert what is currently a haphazard approach to testing geographic variation in species diversity into a systematic search for underlying causes. 	2001	2003226:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	63	9	0.25	0.029411765	0	0.014705882	0.102941176	0	0.058823529	0.014705882	0.338235294	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0.014705882	0.044117647	0.014705882	0.029411765	0.036144578	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.024096386	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.060240964	0.036144578	0.036144578	0	0	0.192771084	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024096386	0.024096386	0.036144578	0	0	0	0	0	0.024096386	0	0	0.072289157	0	0	0	0.024096386	0	0.012048193	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0.036144578	0.024096386	0.012048193	0.012048193	0	0	0	0.204819277	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024096386	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3640	" ;Gelfand, Alan; Rebelo, Anthony; Silander, John; Cowling, Richard; "	Macro ecology and biogeography: Hierarchical (Bayesian) model development using data from South Africa	 We propose a Working Group that will focus on developing hierarchical (Bayesian) statistical models to explain joint spatial patterns in plant species distributions (and thus diversity) using unique datasets from South Africa.

The models will be hierarchical in attempting to explain joint patterns of species distributions thus getting at diversity directly from a mechanistic perspective. We know of no other studies which have taken this approach. In building validating and comparing the models we have access to unique data sets from South Africa: 1) the Protea Atlas species inventory; 2) A set of explanatory GIS data layers for the Cape Floristic Region (CFR); 3) cladistic phylogenetic data on taxa in the Proteaceae; 4) a database of up to 4000 releves from the CFR; and 5) potentially access to a database of the distribution (at degree grid cells) of all 23 000 flowering plant species in Southern Africa.

Moreover understanding the responses of species to climate change is becoming increasingly important because of the effect humans have on the environment. Predicting how macroecological patterns will change in response to patterns of global warming may allow us to better prepare for the consequences of our actions through informed conservation practices and land use strategies. Comprehensive and spatially explicit data on Pleistocene mammals provide a unique opportunity to perform such spatiotemporal analyses. Community structure was dynamic: many species with historically sympatric ranges are now allopatric. I propose to examine macroecological patterns across the fluid landscape of community structure during the last forty thousand years.

I would like to spend 9 months of my upcoming sabbatical (Sept. 2002 June 2003) at NCEAS working on three projects that examine the processes regulating species diversity at geographical scales ranging from local communities to cross continental patterns. The first of these projects examines one of the fundamental mechanisms thought to regulate species diversity within a local community the extent of spatial heterogeneity in resource availability and the richness of the regional species pool. To examine these mechanisms I will analyze three years of field data from an experimental manipulation of soil nutrient heterogeneity and regional species pools on the diversity of plant species in a prairie savanna community. Results from this study will be synthesized relative to other studies that have manipulated soil nutrients plant productivities and species pools. In the second project I will be examining the importance of climate and available energy in determining patterns of species richness across very broad spatial scales  continents). This work will be conducted as part of an ongoing NCEAS working group in   Energy and geographic variation in species richness  . The above projects focus on ecological mechanisms thought to regulate biodiversity at varying spatial scales. Differences in species richness between geographical regions or biomes  tropics versus temperate zone) however are ultimately determined by differential rates of evolutionary diversification (speciation minus extinction). Therefore the third project I want to undertake while on sabbatical is to examine how differences in species diversity between the tropics and temperate regions  the latitudinal gradient) may be generated by differential rates of evolutionary diversification.

Although the ubiquity of gradients in species richness is well documented at coarse scales of resolution it is unclear to what extent patterns are recapitulated at the level of local communities or for any other aspect of biodiversity (Stevens and Willig 2001). Biodiversity represents the totality of variation in living things (Tilman 2000). Thus it is likely that no one measure such as species richness or any one perspective such as that of taxonomic diversity can provide a comprehensive characterization. Investigations that simultaneously explore fundamental components of biodiversity  taxonomic functional or phylogenetic diversity) will allow for analyses that provide deeper more comprehensive understanding regarding the distribution of biota across space and time. Although secondary gradients  latitudinal diversity gradients) have been described ubiquitously much less is known about the primary environmental gradients or suite of gradients that cause such patterns. Numerous biotic and abiotic characteristics vary spatially in different but correlated ways. Distinguishing the relative contributions of a number of environmental characteristics to gradients in biodiversity will contribute substantially to our understanding of ecology biogeography and evolution. Moreover resolution of the effects of primary gradients on the spatial distribution of biodiversity may also greatly enhance our understanding of the mechanistic basis of secondary gradients such as those described for latitude.

Now a multi institutional international team of researchers is building the most accurate species distribution database possible for the entire tropical and subtropical Atlantic.

After a century and a half of research on biodiversity patterns and processes Brown asserted that a general explanation for patterns of biodiversity would emerge in the next few years particularly for elevational and latitudinal patterns. Elevational gradients hold enormous potential for understanding general properties of biodiversity since variable topography is global and predictable climatic patterns with large concomitant changes in biodiversity occur over small spatial scales. Additionally biodiversity studies along elevational gradients have been amassed for many taxa on mountain ranges across the globe. Lomolino outlined some testable diversity hypotheses in a research agenda which would lead to a general explanation for elevational patterns including climatic hypotheses species area effects community overlap patterns and historical factors. In the first quantitative synthesis I tested some of the predictions for elevational diversity patterns of non volant small mammals (n equals 51) with intriguing results. Peak alpha diversity occurred at higher elevations on taller mountains evidence supporting a combination of climatic factors influencing diversity patterns. In contrast gamma diversity patterns supported the predictions of the mid domain effect displayed a positive linear trend with latitude and showed trends consistent with species area effects. To further examine these preliminary trends I propose addressing the following questions: (1) Is there a latitudinal trend in elevation of peaks in diversity on mountainsides? (2) Does the species area relationship inherent to elevational gradients mask other mechanisms producing and maintaining biodiversity? (3) Is there general support for the community overlap hypothesis on elevational gradients? (4) Are there general mechanisms producing elevational diversity patterns across taxa? 	2004	2007337:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	9	0.040816327	0.040816327	0.102040816	0.020408163	0.102040816	0.040816327	0.12244898	0.102040816	0.163265306	0	0.040816327	0.12244898	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.040816327	0.020408163	0.134328358	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.044776119	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.253731343	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0.059701493	0	0	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0.044776119	0.014925373	0	0	0	0	0	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0	0	0.014925373	0.029850746	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0	0	0	0.029850746	0	0	0	0	0.074626866	0	0	0.029850746					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7940	" ;Findlay, C.

Such a broad research agenda implies data sharing among many researchers from diverse geographic regions. Many of the technological barriers to data sharing have been and are being addressed but there still exist many sociological obstacles to data sharing because researchers are often understandably reluctant to share hard won datasets. We propose to identify the key barriers to data sharing and provide incentives to overcome these barriers. Once an effective data sharing model is developed we will build a   pilot   database using multi species site and time period datasets contributed by the working group participants. This database will be used to answer fundamental ecological questions such as; Are more diverse communities more stable? Is the diversity stability relationship scale taxon or habitat specific? Are natural communities regulated primarily by biotic or abiotic factors? Does the answer to that question depend on the scale taxa and or habitats being studies? Do spatial and temporal variability change in some predictable way with scale? This working group is intended to be a pilot project for a large scale consortium of ecologists sharing multi species site and time period datasets to derive general ecological principles. 	2004	200633:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	3	9	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2053	" ;Fagan, William; "	How habitat edges change species interactions		1996	1996372:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	10	9	0.028571429	0.042857143	0	0.014285714	0.085714286	0.014285714	0.185714286	0.042857143	0.5	0	0.014285714	0	0	0.028571429	0.028571429	0.014285714	0.011494253	0	0	0.022988506	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0.287356322	0	0	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.114942529	0.011494253	0.011494253	0	0.011494253	0.022988506	0	0	0	0	0.011494253	0	0	0.011494253	0	0	0.022988506	0	0	0	0.045977011	0.022988506	0.022988506	0.011494253	0.011494253	0	0.022988506	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.08045977	0	0.022988506	0.011494253	0	0.034482759	0.011494253	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022988506	0	0	0	0	0	0.011494253	0	0.011494253	0	0	0	0	0.011494253	0	0.011494253	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9300	" ;Hurlbert, Allen; "	Exploring the Swiss Cheese Effect: The causes and consequences of patchily occupied species ranges	 Although the geographic range is a fundamental unit of analysis for many macroecological and biogeographical studies as a representation of the spatial distribution of individuals it is clearly a scale dependent abstraction. As any amateur naturalist realizes a species is not guaranteed to be present at every point within the range delimited by a field guide. The degree to which a species is predictably encountered within its range varies tremendously across species. Using paired datasets on species ranges and survey data for birds butterflies and small mammals I plan to quantify the variation in range occupancy across species and identify the primary species level traits  body size population density habitat specialization) that explain this variation. The porous nature of species ranges also has consequences for community level analyses. The overlaying of range maps leads to an overestimate of species richness for local communities as well as to the perceived coexistence of species that may not actually coexist at a biologically meaningful spatial scale. I also propose to examine the degree to which local community composition as identified by surveys represents a non random subset of the regional pool (as defined by range maps) using simulation analyses. 	2005	2008378:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	26	9	0.03125	0.0625	0.0625	0.03125	0.15625	0.125	0.03125	0.03125	0.1875	0.03125	0.0625	0.03125	0.15625	0	0	0	0.026315789	0.052631579	0.052631579	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.052631579	0.078947368	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.078947368	0	0	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.157894737	0.078947368	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0.078947368	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0.078947368	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.052631579	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9500	" ;Allen, Andrew; "	The role of temperature in the origin and maintenance of biodiversity	 The mechanisms responsible for latitudinal gradients in biodiversity are still poorly understood.

Jonathan; "	 Coexistence competition and character evolution in carnivores and primates 	 Explaining species coexistence is one of the principal goals of ecology. Competition is thought to inhibit coexistence among species occupying the same ecological niche. Hence species sharing similar ecological traits are predicted to overlap less in their geographical range. However the lack of robust null models and the scarcity of appropriate data have meant that the importance of competition in structuring ecological communities has proven hard to evaluate and remains controversial. In addition other factors may dominate patterns of species overlap and trait similarity; for example sympatric species might be similar due to convergent evolution as a consequence of sharing a similar environment or they may have only recently diverged and therefore be similar by descent. Phylogenetic approaches enable the confounding influence of evolutionary history to be controlled for and provide a simple null model for evaluating the relationship between coexistence and character divergence. This project uses new species level phylogenetic trees along with extensive databases on species traits and distributions within mammals to perform global analyses of species overlap and divergence across multiple carnivore and primate communities. Specifically this project aims to evaluate whether divergence in ecological traits facilitates coexistence in these clades. 	2007	2010420:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	27	9	0	0.065217391	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0.02173913	0.108695652	0	0.5	0	0.02173913	0.065217391	0.108695652	0	0	0.065217391	0.050847458	0	0	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0.13559322	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.033898305	0.016949153	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0	0	0	0.06779661	0.254237288	0	0	0.016949153	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.033898305	0	0	0	0	0.033898305	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.050847458	0.06779661	0.050847458	0	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10941	" ;Rahbek, Carsten; Colwell, Robert; Gotelli, Nicholas; "	Synthetic macroecological models of species diversity	 A major unsolved problem in macroecology and biogeography is the origin and maintenance of species richness gradients.

This working group will seek to develop a novel synthesis of historical contemporary environmental and MDE hypotheses by modeling species geographic ranges in an environmentally heterogeneous geographical domain with spatially explicit colonization range expansion speciation and extinction. 	2006	200850:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	27	9	0.076923077	0.057692308	0.019230769	0.057692308	0	0.057692308	0.019230769	0.038461538	0.384615385	0.019230769	0.019230769	0.115384615	0.038461538	0.038461538	0	0.057692308	0	0	0.01369863	0	0.054794521	0.082191781	0	0	0	0	0.01369863	0.01369863	0.02739726	0	0	0	0	0.04109589	0.01369863	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0	0.191780822	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0.02739726	0	0.02739726	0	0	0.01369863	0.01369863	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0.02739726	0.095890411	0.01369863	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0.02739726	0	0.04109589	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02739726	0.01369863	0	0.01369863	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0.04109589	0	0	0.01369863	0.02739726	0.02739726	0	0	0	0.01369863					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2084	" ;Kaufman, Dawn; "	The latitudinal gradient of diversity: Synthesis of pattern and process	 The latitudinal gradient of species diversity is a nearly universal pattern (Brown 1995) and latitude has been said to have the   boldest signature   with respect to the spatial distribution of biodiversity. In fact the inverse relationship between species richness and latitude is known from a diverse set of taxa including vertebrates (mammals; birds; herptiles; fish non vertebrate chordates (tunicates) invertebrates (ants papilionid butterflies termites crayfish amphipods gastropods coral) protozoans (fossil foraminiferans) and plants (columnar cacti fossil angiosperms trees orchids). Although many studies appear each year on this topic progress to ascertain a convincing general underlying mechanism has been stymied. The current ecological approach to research on the latitudinal gradient suffers from a lack of rigor and creativity in the examination of the pattern and in the quest for the process (detailed below). In addition progress should be enhanced by capitalizing on new technologies to handle large datasets and perform comparative research across taxa to search for generalities. 	1998	200051:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	27	9	0.154761905	0.035714286	0	0.047619048	0.023809524	0.023809524	0.011904762	0.023809524	0.523809524	0	0	0.047619048	0.05952381	0	0.023809524	0.023809524	0	0	0.009345794	0.028037383	0	0	0	0	0	0.028037383	0	0.009345794	0.018691589	0.046728972	0	0.009345794	0	0.065420561	0	0.018691589	0	0.009345794	0.009345794	0.037383178	0	0	0.214953271	0	0	0.046728972	0	0	0.018691589	0	0.009345794	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0.028037383	0	0	0.009345794	0.018691589	0	0.037383178	0	0	0.046728972	0	0	0	0.009345794	0.037383178	0.037383178	0.009345794	0.009345794	0	0	0.009345794	0	0.028037383	0.009345794	0	0	0.046728972	0	0.009345794	0	0	0.018691589	0	0	0	0	0.018691589	0	0	0.009345794	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0.009345794					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2085	" ;Willig, Michael; "	Latitudinal gradients of diversity: A taxonomically and geographically comparative perspective	 The ubiquity of latitudinal gradients in species diversity has led to a search for biological mechanisms that have universal applicability  a primary cause).

The objectives of the Working Group are to document patterns of diversity on different spatial and temporal scales and to integrate causes between scales. At small scales the extraordinarily high level of species coexistence in the deep sea remains a major challenge to contemporary ecological theory. Patterns of local diversity will be examined using existing published and unpublished data from precision sampling and in situ experimental research in the context of spatially explicit computer models (using NCEAS facilities) to determine on what scales disturbance and patch dynamics can realistically account for variation in local diversity and species composition. The key obstacle to analyzing and explaining large scale geographic patterns in the deep sea is that the enormous amount of existing data generated by independent research programs has simply never been compiled into a synthetic workable database. We propose to develop (again using NCEAS facilities) the first large scale database for the deep North Atlantic to provide a framework for understanding the relationships between ecological processes operating at local regional and oceanwide scales as well as the potential historical evolutionary causes of large scale patterns. The absence of a consolidated database also has precluded any serious critical effort to formulate conservation and ecosystem management strategies for the deep sea benthos one of Earths richest biotas and one for which remediation may be impossible. We plan to translate the empirical findings of the Working Group into a sound scientific framework for conservation protocols and address how these protocols can be incorporated into governmental environmental regulations. This Working Group could alter very fundamentally the way we understand deep sea ecology and establish a coordinated international agenda for future research programs. We propose to publish results of the Working Group as a well integrated book and to make the database available to the ecological community and to work directly with NOAA MMS and EPA to promulgate public policy on deep sea conservation.  	1998	200091:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	63	9	0.082644628	0.016528926	0.074380165	0	0.016528926	0.016528926	0.090909091	0.008264463	0.380165289	0.008264463	0.049586777	0.107438017	0.066115702	0.008264463	0.074380165	0	0	0	0	0	0.024	0.024	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0.024	0.048	0.008	0	0.008	0.008	0.016	0	0.024	0	0.016	0	0	0.056	0.024	0	0.04	0.008	0.024	0	0	0	0.008	0.008	0	0	0	0.024	0.016	0	0.04	0.064	0	0.024	0	0	0.008	0.016	0	0	0.04	0	0.04	0.056	0	0.016	0.008	0	0	0	0.12	0	0	0	0.008	0	0	0.016	0.016	0.008	0.008	0	0.008	0.008	0	0	0	0	0	0.048	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2148	" ;Case, Ted; "	 The biogeography of endemism age and area 	 I will be working on three projects during my sabbatical stay at NCEAS. I am very interested in the quantitative relationship between the degree of habitat destruction (and deterioration) and species loss and gain in defined geographic areas. For example if 50 PeRcEnT of native habitat is converted to man modified habitats on an island what proportion of native species are expected to become extinct? How will the success of exotic species be affected? Previous work shows that this is going to be related to overall island area the degree of endemism of the fauna and the habitat diversity on the island. I have accumulated bird and reptile faunas and geographical information on about 70 regions of the world mostly insular and I have already published on some of the relationships. For example statistically there is a strong association with the degree of historical extinction and the degree of endemism in these taxa. Additionally the number of introduced species of land birds is closely related to the number of extinct species. At NCEAS I will attempt to understand these relationships at a more mechanistic level by: 1) Developing a model to explain the geographic roots of endemism. 2) Determining the relationship between island size isolation per cent endemism and habitat diversity. 3) And finally merge these models to predict the expected relationship between habitat destruction and island features (area isolation endemism) and relate these predictions to historical observations in the data set. Secondly I would like to spend more time working on ongoing projects that I am involved in at the Center. Mike Goodchild Carolyn Hunsaker Mark Friedl and I will be editing a book based on the ongoing working group entitled   PERSPECTIVES ON UNCERTAINTY IN SPATIAL DATA FOR ECOLOGICAL MODELS  . Robert Holt and I will also be writing chapters stemming from the ongoing working group on   Species Borders  . Here I am also interested in doing so primary synthetic work on the subject. In particular I think it would be interesting to imbed models of character displacement which Mark Taper and I developed earlier onto an explicit spatial dimension. The questions are how is the possibility of escape in space going to affect the likelyhood and degree of character displacement? And how does the possibility of character displacement modify the evolution of species geographic range limits?  	1998	199910:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	10	0.106382979	0.063829787	0.021276596	0.063829787	0.063829787	0.212765957	0	0	0.021276596	0.255319149	0.021276596	0	0	0.021276596	0.042553191	0.106382979	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0	0.035087719	0	0.087719298	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0.035087719	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.192982456	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.070175439	0	0	0.157894737	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.070175439	0	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.035087719	0.01754386	0	0	0.035087719	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2017	" ;Prince, Stephen; "	Global Primary Production Data Initiative	 We propose to conduct a 2 week Working Group to develop a methodology for extrapolating sparse field observations of net primary production (NPP) including environmental controls on carbon allocation to create a database representative of major worldwide vegetation and environmental regimes.

The advent of satellite based remote sensing within the past two decades has enabled us to assess global patterns of phenology NPP and carbon sequestration. However the satellite record is far too short to determine centennial or longer trends. Therefore we must look to new avenues if we are to place the 20 yearrecord of satellite measured terrestrial NPP within the context of the steady adjustments of plant populations in response to long term changes in climate and atmospheric CO2. Fossil pollen data provide continuous records spanning millennia that demonstrate the large shifts in the ranges and abundances in plant populations that have occurred since the last glacial maximum (LGM) 21 000 years ago. Maps of modern pollen abundances clearly show that the pollen percentage of a plant taxon reflects its abundance on the landscape. Although there have been several attempts to estimate the past amounts of carbon stored in the terrestrial biosphere most of these attempts have not made use of process based biogeochemistry models and their estimates have ranged widely. I suggest a pioneering approach to determine the past productivity and carbon sequestration of the terrestrial biosphere. I plan to synthesize the information contained in the pollen and satellite vegetation records to estimate the leaf area index (LAI) of past ecosystems then use the inferred LAI maps of past land cover already published (Williams . 1998; Williams . in press) and paleoclimatic simulations to run BIOME BGC a sophisticated biogeochemistry model that predicts NPP and carbon sequestration by directly simulating the processes of photosynthesis respiration and carbon allocation (Running and Hunt 1993). The goal is to produce maps of LAI NPP and carbon storage for key time periods in the past. These maps will be highly relevant to those seeking to understand the present day interactions between vegetation productivity climate and atmospheric CO2 and the potential for the system to change.  	1999	2001126:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	7	10	0.0875	0	0.0125	0.0625	0.05	0.075	0.1	0.0125	0.1375	0.325	0.0125	0.0375	0.0125	0.0125	0.0375	0.025	0.011627907	0.011627907	0	0	0.011627907	0	0.151162791	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0.046511628	0	0.11627907	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.093023256	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0.139534884	0	0	0.023255814	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0.046511628	0	0.081395349	0	0	0.046511628	0.046511628	0	0	0	0.011627907	0.023255814	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2208	" ;Holland, Elisabeth; Field, Christopher; Kohlmaier, Gundolf; Harmon, Mark; "	The carbon balance of Eurasia and North America	 We propose a working group including an NCEAS postdoc configured to fill a series of critical gaps in our ability to quantify and understand the carbon balance of large regions.

Ecosystem models that link nutrient cycling with plant production generally predict long term photosynthetic downregulation and reduced stimulation in plant production caused by progressive N constraints in elevated CO2. The conceptual model is that increased carbon (C) influx under elevated CO2 will immobilize more N in plant biomass and soil organic matter progressively leading to less N available for plant uptake. However the predicted downregulation in primary production has not been confirmed by most of the free air CO2 enrichment (FACE) and open top chamber (OTC) experiments. The discrepancy between model predictions and experimental data apparently results from a fundamental knowledge gap concerning ecosystem C and N interactions which lie at the core of ecosystem ecology. The proposed working group will address the issue of progressive N limitations by (1) compilation and synthesis of experimental data from the on going FACE and OTC projects as well as from the literature; (2) synthesis of published modeling results and comparison of mechanisms incorporated into various models; (3) identification of possible mechanisms causing the discrepancy between model predictions and experimental results; and (4) defining future research need for both experimental and modeling studies. This project has the potential to make a critical contribution to ecosystem ecology. Moreover a solid understanding of C:N interactions extends beyond ecology. Models increasingly applied to policy questions appear to have major problems matching the aspects of experimental results. The latter are most relevant to the policy applications. The ability of the ecological community to provide useful information on the future carbon dynamics of the terrestrial biosphere (including the terrestrial sink) depends critically on resolving the question of progressive N limitation. 	2001	2002251:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	10	0.304347826	0.028985507	0.062801932	0.009661836	0.009661836	0.09178744	0	0	0.019323671	0.371980676	0.009661836	0.019323671	0.019323671	0.028985507	0.014492754	0.009661836	0.003311258	0	0	0	0.188741722	0	0.102649007	0	0	0	0.006622517	0	0	0.003311258	0.003311258	0	0	0.321192053	0.003311258	0	0	0.013245033	0	0	0.023178808	0	0	0	0.003311258	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.003311258	0	0.036423841	0.003311258	0	0	0	0	0.009933775	0	0.099337748	0	0	0	0	0	0.006622517	0.009933775	0	0.016556291	0	0.009933775	0	0.026490066	0.003311258	0	0.016556291	0.039735099	0.003311258	0.006622517	0	0	0.003311258	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016556291	0	0	0	0.013245033	0	0.003311258					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4400	" ;Hibbard, Kathy; "	Intercomparison of global scale ecological models and field data: EMDI II	 Understanding global scale ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions is important both as a scientific question and as the basis for making policy decisions. The confidence in regional models depends on how well the field data used to develop the model represent the region of interest how well the environmental driving variables represent the region of interest and how well regional model predictions agree with observed data for the region. To assess the accuracy of global model forecasts of terrestrial carbon cycling the first Ecosystem Model Data Intercomparison (EMDI) workshop was held in December 1999. We propose that the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) co sponsor with the Global Analysis Interpretation and Modeling Task Force (GAIM) of the International Geosphere Biosphere Program the EMDI II Working Group to be held at Santa Barbara in mid April 2001. This request describes the EMDI I progress past NCEAS support and outlines the EMDI II activities. The EMDI I workshop included 12 biogeochemical satellite driven detailed process and dynamic vegetation global model types. Extensive worldwide net primary productivity (NPP) data were assembled; model driver data including vegetation climate and soils were associated with each site; model simulations were performed; and the model data differences analyzed. NPP and model driver data were compiled for 1200 study sites and for over 2100 0.5 degree grid cells. Initial results showed general agreement between model predictions of NPP and field measurements of NPP but with obvious differences that indicated areas for potential data and model improvement. Comparing the input data with an average NPP from an ensemble of model outputs provided a unique tool to improve NPP data model driver data and model processes. The workshop demonstrated that model data intercomparison is an important new direction in model evaluation; but one that is an extraordinarily complex task. NCEAS has provided significant support for EMDI and NPP data compilation. The workshop to analyze the first EMDI was hosted by the GAIM office however NCEAS provided support for a student intern to organize the data and an FTP site for distribution. Much of the NPP data for EMDI came directly from the   Development of a Consistent Worldwide Net Primary Production (NPP) Database   funded by NCEAS. Ten papers and four global data sets were generated from the series of three Working Groups (see http: daacl.esd.ornl.gov npq nceas nceas des.html). This and the preliminary Web page describing EMDI demonstrate how NCEAS supported data synthesis analysis activities have resulted in new ecological data that are available for the wider scientific community and that will be used for the proposed EMDI II Working Group. The EMDI II Working Group will include all initial models except one (model is no longer supported) and has expanded to include 5 additional global groups. The group now includes 16 models primarily from Europe and North America but one in China and one in Australia. The participating models will utilize data sets that have been improved through outlier analysis and perform new model runs for a set of approximately 4000 0.5 grid cells. Whereas the analysis in EMDI I was based on comparing ensemble values averaged from all 12 models strictly for total (above and belowground) NPP EMDI II will compare model results with NPP data for individual models and also require models to supply above and belowground NPP estimates to assess how models allocate carbon in various biomes relative to the data. In addition we plan to assemble multi year NPP estimates for a variety of sites to compare to multi year model estimates. In addition to the analysis of differences between models and data EMDI will produce an enhanced multi layered data collection again that will be made available for additional use by the wider scientific community. The enhancements include associating climate soils NDVI and vegetation characteristics with each of the NPP measurements and performing an outlier analysis to address data quality concerns. We propose a co funded workshop by IGBP GAIM and NCEAS. Total estimated costs for 20 participants for 5 days is  DoLlQuAnT 25k of which GAIM will supply  DoLlQuAnT 15k. We are requesting additional support from NCEAS for  DoLlQuAnT 10k to cover additional costs. The proposed timetable is as follows: (1) Driver data is posted for a 50 PeRcEnT blind comparison of grid cells (as of 3 January) (2) NPP values for the 50 PeRcEnT blind cells will be provided to models that submit their results by 7 February (3) Driver data for additional 50 PeRcEnT data cells posted 7 February (4) Model results are requested by 28 March (5) Post model results to UNH website for models to view by 4 April.

Among these key components freshwater and wetland ecosystems have been largely ignored or assumed negligible. Recent literature suggests that freshwater ecosystems contribute significantly to some regional carbon balances. We hypothesize based on a preliminary assessment of the easily available data that these key components are critical for a reliable estimation of carbon movements at a global scale as well. While the oceans and terrestrial forests are responsible for the net uptake of atmospheric CO2 freshwater ecosystems process a large amount of terrestrially derived primary production and alter the balance between C sequestration and net CO2 release. This project aims at synthesizing existing information on the linkage between terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems to yield an improved representation of carbon cycling. 	2003	2005313:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	59	10	0.130434783	0	0.152173913	0.02173913	0	0.043478261	0.02173913	0.108695652	0	0.282608696	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.086956522	0.065217391	0	0	0	0	0.102564103	0	0	0	0	0	0.012820513	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.012820513	0.115384615	0	0	0.012820513	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012820513	0	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.102564103	0	0.012820513	0	0.038461538	0.012820513	0	0	0	0	0.025641026	0.012820513	0	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0.012820513	0	0.243589744	0	0.051282051	0.012820513	0.012820513	0	0.025641026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012820513	0.012820513	0.012820513	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012820513	0	0.038461538					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6840	" ;Harmon, Mark; "	 Analysis of long term litter decomposition experiments: Synthesis at the site regional and global levels 	 Although numerous short term experiments have been used to develop conceptual and simulation models of decomposition very little is known about the later stages of this process. Exclusion of this later stage has led at best to incomplete understanding of ecosystem carbon and nitrogen dynamics. We propose a working group to examine the wealth of litter and decomposition data that has been produced by several recent long term field experiments. Our analysis will initially be based on data from LIDET (Long term Intersite Decomposition Experiment Team) a 27 site experiment conducted over a 10 year period. We will then incorporate results of other networks in Canada and Europe as well as other long term results into this synthesis.

Here we propose a series of working group activities to synthesize ecosystem scale 15N tracer experiments across a wide geographic range of ecosystem types. While at NCEAS we propose to develop three products: (1) a standardized protocol for application and analysis of 15N tracer studies (2) a meta analysis of the fate and redistribution of N across sites and ecosystem types and (3) an inter site comparison with the TRACE model a simulation model that predicts the fate of N inputs over long time scales.

Potentially vulnerable carbon pools that currently contain hundreds of billion tons of carbon could be destabilized through global warming and land use change. Some of the most vulnerable pools on land and oceans are: soil carbon in permafrost soil carbon in high and low latitude wetlands biomass carbon in forests methane hydrates in the coastal zone and ocean carbon concentrated by the biological pump. The risk of large losses from these pools is not well known and is not included in most climate simulations. Preliminary analyses indicate a risk over the coming century that may be larger than 200 ppm of atmospheric CO2 rivaling the expected release from fossil fuel combustion.

Abiotic effects propagate through all levels of ecosystem organization providing opportunities to develop the integrative models needed to assess and predict important interactive effects of multiple stressors. For example when invertebrates bioaccumulate metals above thresholds beyond which some species cannot regulate metal intake it leads to impaired growth reproduction and survival that alter the structure of invertebrate communities in ways that should be predictable. I propose to develop models that couple the geochemistry of natural waters as altered by UV exposure with the biological uptake of metals and the resulting structure of invertebrate communities. Current regulatory policy for metals generally ignores most natural variation and the synergistic impacts of multiple stressors  seasonal and temporal fluctuations in metal concentrations coupled with UV exposure).

David; Melillo, Jerry; Prinn, Ronald; "	 Toward an adequate quantification of CH4 emissions from land ecosystems: Integrating field and in situ observations satellite data and modeling 	 Emissions of CH4 from natural and managed land ecosystems account for a significant source of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. In recent decades extensive field observations of CH4 emissions and atmospheric CH4 concentrations have been made during a time in which process based and inversion modeling approaches have matured as powerful tools in estimating regional and global CH4 emissions. However there are still substantial uncertainties in estimating CH4 exchange with the atmosphere. Much of this uncertainty arises from uncertainties in the extent of wetland distributions and incomplete understanding of the controls and mechanisms of methanogenesis methanotrophy and CH4 transport pathways to the atmosphere. Furthermore there is variability in which factors control CH4 production and consumption in different natural and managed ecosystems. For example in northern high latitudes permafrost dynamics significantly influences emissions while the seasonality of wetland extent is critical in determining emissions from tropical regions. For managed ecosystems  rice paddies) irrigation and fertilization significantly impact both methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Here we propose a Working Group to make progress in synthesis of CH4 dynamics through three activities: 1) to identify key issues in quantifying CH4 emissions from land ecosystems through conducting comparisons of model and field observations for different geographical locations and ecosystems; 2) to parameterize and extrapolate process based models at regional and global scales and explore the uncertainty of CH4 emissions; and 3) to couple process based estimates with inversion modeling approaches to constrain the uncertainty with air borne satellite and in situ observed datasets and to identify the factors mechanisms and controls to the uncertainty of emissions at large scales. 	2006	2009451:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	24	10	0	0.142857143	0.142857143	0	0	0.071428571	0	0	0	0.214285714	0.071428571	0	0.214285714	0	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.068965517	0.034482759	0	0.103448276	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0.344827586	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.068965517	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12025	" ;Brown, James; "	The Scale of Life	 Most of my research concerns the related topics of biological scaling and metabolic theory.

However climate change may alter the natural cycling of carbon (C) in ecosystems far from direct human influence. Because of the size and nature of the permafrost C pool decomposition of previously frozen old organic C is one of the most likely positive feedbacks from terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. Sustained transfers of C to the atmosphere that could cause a significant positive feedback from permafrost to climate change must come from old C which forms the bulk of the permafrost C pool. Radiocarbon measurements of ecosystem respiration losses provide the definitive proof of old C mobilization in natural ecosystems undergoing change. Two synthesis activities relating to this topic will be carried out as a sabbatical fellow at the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis. The first activity consists of compiling and analyzing soil incubation data from the published literature to understand the relative climate forcing effect of methane and carbon dioxide released from decomposing permafrost C. The second activity is the organization and writing of an isotope textbook focused on the use radiocarbon in ecology and earth system science. This activity will synthesize 5 years of materials developed for a short course taught at the Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometer facility at UC Irvine.

Tidal wetlands are a potentially effective sink for carbon through accretionary processes both in response to sea level rise or via restoration. Tidal wetlands also have low methane emissions making restoration of these wetlands a promising technique for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Research to date on tidal wetland carbon dynamics has been uncoordinated geographically and narrowly focused. Carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emissions are complicated as belowground biomass accumulation and methane production increase from saline to freshwater tidal settings. There is a real need not only to synthesize work in different parts of the country and on different aspects of wetland carbon budgets but also to incorporate understanding from multiple fields into an integrated model of wetland carbon dynamics including production decomposition sequestration and greenhouse gas GHG emissions. An integrated model would provide the scientific framework to guide wetland climate change mitigation and adaptation policies on many scales. State regional national and international initiatives are rapidly being implemented to reduce GHG emissions through cap and trade systems. Carbon offset protocols are essential for any carbon trading program which requires development of reliable quantified performance standards. Sale of the carbon offsets from tidal wetland restoration projects could be a significant new funding mechanism for restoration with billions of dollars of offsets expected to be sold in the next five years. The proposed working group will evaluate and test the potential to develop empirically based and process based models of carbon dynamics that identify variations in sequestration and emissions across gradients of salinity inundation tidal range and suspended sediment supply. The working group will include experts in a wide range of fields including the development of carbon offset protocols to ensure that the products of the working group will directly integrate with GHG emissions reduction programs. 	2010	201196:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	60	10	0.078947368	0	0.289473684	0.052631579	0	0.052631579	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.026315789	0.394736842	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0.026315789	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0.037735849	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.264150943	0.320754717	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2153	" ;Grimm, Nancy; "	Aquatic terrestrial Biogeochemistry	 MERGING TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC PERSPECTIVES OF BIOGEOCHEMISTRY There is very little interaction among terrestrial and aquatic biogeochemists except where the water meets the land. Thus research in riparian ecotones has been critical in getting ecologists from both groups to think along different lines than they are accustomed to. Yet it seems there is a missed opportunity to blend conceptual models of material cycling in streams and terrestrial ecosystems. For example my colleagues and I have been thinking of how models of nutrient processing along stream riparian and hyporheic flowpaths can be extended up into the catchment in aridland streams and how this might differ from patterns in temperate watersheds (Fisher . 1998). The overall aim of this project is to broaden generalities about nutrient cycling beyond the habitat chauvinism that is prevalent today. We will ask whether a common approach for example one centered on hydrologic models of transport and retention is reasonable for both terrestrial and lotic ecosystems. A working group or series of working groups will consider this question and will include biogeochemists who work in diverse ecosystems modelers hydrologists and other physical scientists. 	1999	2002102:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	41	11	0.02	0.08	0.04	0.02	0.1	0	0	0.1	0.04	0.04	0.18	0.04	0.12	0.06	0.08	0.08	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.018518519	0.037037037	0	0.12962963	0.055555556	0.111111111	0	0.037037037	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0.037037037	0.055555556	0	0.037037037	0.166666667	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2165	" ;Wilson, Will; Abrams, Peter; "	 Extending synthesizing and applying recent advances in competition theory 	 Theoretical work on interspecific competition over the past 15 years has been characterized by the inclusion of an increasing amount of detail regarding the mechanism of population interaction.

These studies have been undertaken largely independently and many have been based on specific systems or assumptions. This proposal has two goals: (1) to explore the relationships between and the interaction of these three components of the mechanism of competition; and (2) to determine if there is empirical evidence for the more general predictions uncovered by work related to the first goal. The second goal will also encompass plans for future empirical studies if evidence is lacking in past work. The working group will include investigators who have been actively involved in developing recent theory as well as empirical biologists who have had experience in meta analysis of published experiments.

Various ecological and biological factors influence the rate of enemy induced mortality suffered by herbivore populations. The major goal of this project is to quantify the effects of these factors on enemy induced mortality as revealed by a life table database of holometabolous herbivores. Although enemy mortality will be emphasized we will also examine mortality caused by weather competition and plant factors. A secondary goal will be to compile and analyze a life table database of hemimetabolous herbivores. All databases will be made available to other workers when the analysis is complete. Enemy induced mortality will be characterized by type (predator parasitoid or pathogen) and the relative importance of each type as well as other causes of death will be tested for differences associated with five ecological characteristics of the herbivores (feeding biology invasion status and the successional stage cultivation status and latitudinal zone of the habitat). The information will also reveal if herbivore ecology affects all enemies equally or if tradeoffs exist such that reductions in the rate of attack by one type of enemy may be offset by increased attacks by other types. If so than the already complex dynamics identified for plant vs. enemy interactions may be further enriched by interactions among the enemies themselves. 	1996	1998186:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	28	11	0	0.045454545	0	0.090909091	0	0.045454545	0.045454545	0.090909091	0.045454545	0	0.545454545	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0.121212121	0.03030303	0.03030303	0	0.272727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.03030303	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.060606061	0	0.060606061	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2621	" ;Juanes, Francis; "	The allometry of predator prey relationships	 My overall goal is to infer ecological generalities from a quantitative description of predator size prey size relationships.

Secondly the interaction between evolutionary benefits of masting  pollination efficiency) and the resource constraints operating within individual plants have not been explored. Third to what extent do pulses in plant reproduction result in   ripple   effects through higher trophic levels?

These ripple effects are important to applied problems  forest pest outbreaks) and also for understanding the evolutionary origins of masting. Thus we propose an interdisciplinary working group (plant evolutionary ecologists animal population ecologists community ecologists modelers)that will use long term datasets on both seed crops and animal densities to formulate predictive models of the nature and consequences of mast seeding. The results will be important both to evolutionary theory and to understanding ecosystem functioning. 	2000	2001206:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	11	0	0.056603774	0	0.056603774	0.113207547	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.037735849	0.528301887	0	0.018867925	0.037735849	0.037735849	0.037735849	0	0	0	0.051724138	0.051724138	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.465517241	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0.137931034	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0.051724138	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3221	" ;Moore, John; Dong, Quan; "	 Detritus and dynamics of populations food webs and communities  	 Food web theory was developed in large part on the pathway of primary production from plants to herbivores to predators even though most primary productivity is uneaten by herbivores and enters the food web as detritus.

Recent work has demonstrated that animal grouping can emerge within a spatial resource consumer model. Such a connection between these two areas provides an ideal situation for linking social interactions between individuals to an individuals resource gathering. This connection enables the general study of the overall selection on an individual possessing both foraging and social behaviors.

With few exceptions the IGP literature falls into two categories operating at different time scales: (1) theory presenting long term effects of IGP on species persistence and population densities and (2) short term studies demonstrating IGP and from theory extrapolating the outcome for populations and communities. In addition IGP models have been formulated for predator prey  Holt and Polis 1997) host parasitoid (Briggs 1993) and host parasite (or pathogen)  Hochberg and Holt 1990) systems. Although the broad predictions of all of these model formulations are the same this commonality is not generally recognized. I propose to synthesize this diffuse body of theory assess the information available from short term empirical studies and test theoretical IGP predictions with empirical data. 	2003	2004325:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	67	11	0	0.205128205	0.153846154	0.051282051	0.025641026	0	0	0.025641026	0	0.102564103	0.256410256	0	0.076923077	0.025641026	0.051282051	0.025641026	0	0.020408163	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.081632653	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0.020408163	0	0	0.06122449	0	0	0	0.040816327	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0.040816327	0.040816327	0.040816327	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.020408163	0	0	0	0.06122449	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0.12244898	0	0.102040816	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0.12244898	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7362	" ;Packer, Craig; "	Serengeti: The origins and future of a complex ecosystem 	 At a third NCEAS meeting we would finalize the chapters for Serengeti III and keep to a schedule whereby we submitted our manuscript to Chicago Press by Jan. 2004.

Recent results suggest that invasive plants become widespread problems in part because they are released from attack by pathogens relative to their native range. However the roles of herbivores and mutualists in plant invasions remain controversial and the potential for interactive effects of natural enemies and mutualists has been little considered. This working group will examine the joint roles of herbivores pollinators mycorrhizal fungi and pathogens in plant invasions. The first goal of this working group will be to more fully quantify the effects of plant introductions on their associations with these enemies and mutualists. We will achieve this by synthesizing existing data on the geographic occurrence and impact of insect herbivores mycorrhizal fungi pollinators and pathogens. We will then examine to what degree changes in naturalized plants associations with these other organisms can explain major patterns in biological invasions particularly variation among naturalized species in their ecological impacts. 	2004	2006369:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	28	11	0.010309278	0.041237113	0.041237113	0	0.030927835	0	0	0.164948454	0.030927835	0.010309278	0.474226804	0.020618557	0.144329897	0	0.010309278	0.020618557	0	0	0	0.009174312	0	0.018348624	0	0	0	0.027522936	0	0	0	0	0.018348624	0	0	0	0.036697248	0.027522936	0.018348624	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.47706422	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009174312	0.018348624	0	0	0	0	0.009174312	0	0	0	0	0	0.073394495	0	0	0	0	0.009174312	0.009174312	0.009174312	0	0	0.018348624	0	0	0.009174312	0.009174312	0	0.055045872	0.055045872	0	0	0	0	0.018348624	0	0.018348624	0	0	0.036697248	0	0	0	0	0.009174312	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9140	" ;Bolnick, Daniel; Preisser, Evan; "	 When and how much does fear matter? Quantitatively assessing the impact of predator intimidation of prey on community dynamics 	 Interactions between predators and their prey are the cornerstone of food web ecology. Ecologists have traditionally thought of such interactions in terms of the number of prey consumed by predators. A mounting array of evidence suggests that prey are far from helpless victims however and that they employ a wide array of defensive strategies. The costs of these strategies can include reduced energy income lower mating success or increased vulnerability to other predators. Predators can thus reduce prey density both through direct consumption (density mediated interactions DMIs ) and through the costs arising from anti predator strategies (trait mediated interactions TMIs ). The presence of TMIs can introduce nonlinearities into species interactions that profoundly affect both short term interactions and longterm population dynamics. We will use meta analysis to evaluate patterns of TMIs across a range of ecosystems taxa and as a function of predator prey and resource density and to determine the relative importance of different forms of TMIs (reductions in feeding mating opportunities reproductive allocation etc) in shaping predator prey interactions. Our empirical results will be used to help develop models of predator prey interactions incorporating both density mediated and a range of trait mediated effects in turn allowing us to generate new hypotheses testable by meta analysis. We will produce: 1) a series of articles including one which proposes TMIappropriate experimental methodologies; 2) an article for the general public; and 3) a comprehensive database of TMI research. 	2005	2006387:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	28	11	0.088235294	0.029411765	0	0.107843137	0	0.068627451	0.058823529	0	0.029411765	0.049019608	0.392156863	0.029411765	0.039215686	0.049019608	0.029411765	0.029411765	0	0	0.008	0	0	0	0	0.008	0.056	0	0	0.04	0	0.112	0	0	0	0.008	0	0	0	0.008	0	0	0.008	0	0	0.216	0	0	0	0.032	0.008	0.008	0.008	0	0.08	0.016	0.008	0.008	0.008	0	0	0.032	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008	0	0.016	0	0	0.008	0	0	0.048	0.008	0.008	0	0.048	0.024	0	0	0.024	0	0	0.008	0	0.024	0	0.008	0.032	0	0.024	0	0	0	0.032	0.008	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9861	" ;Lovvorn, James; "	Physiological limits on realized patch structure and trophic coupling from krill to diving seabirds	 As marine food webs are increasingly altered by climate change and human exploitation it is often desirable to estimate the amount of prey at one trophic level that is needed to sustain higher trophic levels. Critical to such estimates is the tightness of trophic coupling or the fraction of prey that are effectively available and eaten by predators. For example small diving seabirds are limited in dive depth so that even abundant prey like krill are unavailable unless they come near the surface. Thus physiological constraints on these predators can make the realized patch structure of available prey quite different from that of the entire prey population. Availability of pelagic prey is also determined by prey behavior with diel vertical movements that can vary temporally and spatially with bathymetry light levels and tides. Overall prey availability may vary predictably with these factors at large scales (fronts) however smaller scale features (eddies) that concentrate prey into profitable densities are far less predictable and may not be detected without costly exploratory dives. As a result much of the prey is never exploited. In this research I will link models of the foraging energetics of auklets to variations in 3 dimensional dispersion of krill prey over a time series of months and years. In particular I will explore mechanisms and develop predictive models of how physiological limits on prey availability can control and weaken trophic coupling. Resulting concepts and models will have broad utility in foodweb approaches to marine ecosystem management for both quantifying prey stocks needed to support top predators and determining the location and extent of viable foraging habitat. 	2006	2007388:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	11	0	0.088235294	0	0.029411765	0.102941176	0.088235294	0	0	0.058823529	0.117647059	0.352941176	0.058823529	0.029411765	0.044117647	0.029411765	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.032967033	0	0	0	0.043956044	0.032967033	0	0.021978022	0.032967033	0	0.010989011	0	0.010989011	0.010989011	0.032967033	0	0.010989011	0.021978022	0	0.021978022	0	0	0.076923077	0.142857143	0	0.021978022	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0.098901099	0.010989011	0	0.032967033	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.043956044	0	0.043956044	0	0	0.010989011	0.010989011	0.010989011	0	0	0.010989011	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0.087912088	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.032967033	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0.032967033					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		9881	" ;Ritchie, Mark; "	Thermodynamics of trophic interactions: Toward a reconciliation of energy and elements	 Management of the worlds ecosystems in the face of changes in climate availability of carbon nitrogen and other elements and invasion of new species will require a much better understanding of trophic interactions. The study of trophic interactions has historically focused on either the exchange of energy or of critical limiting elements such as nitrogen phosphorus or carbon. These separate currencies generally prevent ecologists from fully understanding variation in the magnitude of trophic interactions and element fluxes across environments that receive different amounts of energy. During my proposed Fellowship I plan to develop a thermodynamic theory of trophic interactions that applies principles of the second law of thermodynamics to interactions between plant resources plants herbivores and predators. Preliminary work suggests a theoretical equivalence rule for energy and element concentrations that successfully predicts previously unrecognized trade offs in plant nutrient concentrations water use efficiency (for terrestrial plants) and tolerance vs. resistance to herbivory. Changes in these plant traits across different environments have potentially profound effects on herbivore abundance and diversity and the likely importance and impact of top predators. To test some of these predictions I plan to synthesize 15 years of experimental data from my own work on plant herbivore interactions and extensive data from the literature. This work is likely to lead to several high profile papers and the identification of critical data needs that might be addressed with a future NCEAS working group. 	2005	2006393:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	11	0.032258065	0.016129032	0.080645161	0.032258065	0.016129032	0.032258065	0.032258065	0	0.032258065	0	0.516129032	0.032258065	0.032258065	0.096774194	0.016129032	0.032258065	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0.021978022	0	0	0	0	0.021978022	0.010989011	0	0	0	0.021978022	0	0.010989011	0.021978022	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0.010989011	0	0.318681319	0	0.010989011	0.010989011	0	0	0.010989011	0	0	0.010989011	0.010989011	0.010989011	0	0.010989011	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.021978022	0.164835165	0	0.010989011	0	0.021978022	0.010989011	0.032967033	0	0	0	0.010989011	0.021978022	0	0	0	0	0.010989011	0.021978022	0.032967033	0.032967033	0	0	0.010989011	0	0.021978022	0.010989011	0	0	0.010989011					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10022	" ;Gruner, Daniel; Shurin, Jonathan; Hillebrand, Helmut; "	Comparing trophic structure across ecosystems	 Trophic structure the partitioning of biomass among organisms at different positions in a food web varies both within and among ecosystems. However the causes of this variation are poorly understood. Eltons   pyramid of numbers   where primary producers dominate and consumer densities decrease as trophic levels become more remote from the base of production applies well to most terrestrial systems. However many aquatic ecosystems apparently violate Eltons rule with inverted biomass pyramids or ratios of heterotroph to autotroph biomass (H:A) greater than one. In this proposal we describe synthetic work aimed at understanding differences in trophic structure and the relative strength of bottom up and top down inputs between diverse freshwater marine and terrestrial ecosystems. We will test candidate hypotheses for this variation based on factors known to distinguish food webs in the two habitats such as nutrient limitation and turnover rates productivity (quantity) and nutrient stoichiometry (quality). Meta analysis of local scale herbivore manipulation experiments will be integrated with theoretical development of food web models and with larger scale temporal and spatial patterns from resource gradients. This work will move us closer to a comprehensive trophic dynamic theory unified across taxa and ecosystem types. It will also increase our mechanistic understanding of how human impacts such as eutrophication or predator extirpation propagate or attenuate in ecosystems through trophic interactions. 	2005	2006401:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	28	11	0.053333333	0.133333333	0.026666667	0.186666667	0.053333333	0	0.04	0.013333333	0.093333333	0.013333333	0.293333333	0.013333333	0.026666667	0.013333333	0.013333333	0.026666667	0.020618557	0.030927835	0	0	0.06185567	0	0	0	0.175257732	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0.030927835	0.010309278	0	0.051546392	0	0.06185567	0.010309278	0.010309278	0	0.020618557	0	0.010309278	0	0.206185567	0.06185567	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020618557	0	0.030927835	0.030927835	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0	0	0	0	0.030927835	0	0.010309278	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0	0	0.010309278	0.020618557	0	0	0	0	0.010309278	0.020618557	0.010309278	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10281	" ;Estes, James; Williams, Terrie; Doak, Daniel; Wootton, J. Timothy; "	Conservation planning for ecosystem functioning: Testing predictions of ecological effectiveness for marine predators 	 At a major symposium on marine ecosystem based management at the 2005 AAAS meetings one of the three principal themes deemed critical for future progress was interaction web dynamics the way in which species interact with one another and their physical environment. In particular the scientific basis for marine ecosystem based management must better incorporate understanding of the influences of multiple predator species on interaction web dynamics. These interactions are increasingly recognized as critical to the maintenance and restoration of marine communities and hence to the planning of marine reserves and other conservation strategies. Our working group will directly tackle this important issue asking what approaches are most successful in estimating the interaction strength also termed ecological effectiveness of predator species on nearshore communities and how to use limited information on these effects to best conduct conservation planning in these ecosystems. We will focus our initial efforts on three extremely well studied predator guilds of West Coast near shore communities: sea otters in kelp forests; predatory whelks in mid intertidal benthic communities and wading shore birds in high to mid intertidal communities. For each of these very different systems extensive data exist on the effects of predator abundance physiology and individual behavior. We will assemble these diverse data sets and use them to develop detailed interaction models as well as more broad brush models that may be applicable to less well studied communities. Our overall goal is to use these models to ask what aspects of predator physiology and behavior and what aspects of prey community structure most determine the ecological effectiveness of predators and thus must be understood in order to plan viable marine conservation strategies. 	2006	2009403:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	59	11	0.013513514	0.081081081	0.054054054	0.013513514	0.067567568	0.013513514	0.121621622	0.027027027	0.162162162	0	0.324324324	0.067567568	0	0	0.013513514	0.040540541	0.011627907	0.011627907	0.011627907	0.011627907	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0.023255814	0.069767442	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.069767442	0.058139535	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.034883721	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0.11627907	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.023255814	0.011627907	0	0.011627907	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0.162790698	0.023255814	0	0	0	0.034883721	0	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0.046511628	0.023255814	0	0	0	0	0	0.023255814	0	0.104651163	0	0.011627907	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10421	" ;Davidson, Diane; Fagan, William; "	Ecological stoichiometry and the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of arthropods	 Stoichiometry the study of the balance of multiple elements in living systems is increasingly recognized as an integrative axis within ecology and across biological disciplines. We seek to characterize a series of little explored links between stoichiometry and the spatial distributions and temporal dynamics of arthropods. These issues lie at the interface of macroecology and macrophysiology. We focus on four arthropod groups where different stoichiometric mechanisms likely help determine species level spatial distributions and or temporal dynamics. These include three taxonomically defined groups (the Orthoptera grasshoppers and crickets the Lepidoptera butterflies and moths and the Hymenoptera ants and bees ) plus one ecologically defined group (troglobites obligate cave dwellers ). Mechanisms link an arthropods stoichiometry with its capacities for growth reproduction and dispersal. We use these linkages as springboards for testing three hypotheses. First focusing on orthopterans and lepidopterans we will characterize how a species stoichiometry is linked to its tendency to exhibit   outbreak   dynamics and what elements are most important. Second focusing on hymenopterans and troglobites we will test how an arthropods stoichiometric content relates to the breadth of habitats it exploits. Lastly focusing on orthopterans hymenopterans lepidopterans and other arthropods we will test whether these same stoichiometric mechanisms imply that the elemental content of some species will predispose them to respond to global change via shifts in their geographic ranges. We will address these three issues by characterizing the   intersections   of several ecological databases. Our work will be primarily from an empirical ecoinformatic perspective; however we will complement these efforts with theoretical modeling of insect outbreak dynamics in stoichiometrically explicit population models. 	2006	2007445:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	11	0.042553191	0	0	0.106382979	0.021276596	0	0	0.127659574	0.085106383	0	0.468085106	0.021276596	0.042553191	0.063829787	0.021276596	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0.02	0.02	0.02	0	0	0.02	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0.02	0.02	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0.02	0.38	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0.06	0	0.02	0.02	0.04	0.02	0.02	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0.02	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		11961	" ;Schulz, Kimberly; "	Food quality effects on ecological efficiency at multiple scales in aquatic systems	 I am interested in how the biochemical composition of food (food quality) affects the performance and fitness of consumers and how these nutritional effects on individuals translate to higher ecological levels such as population dynamics community composition and trophic transfer efficiency.

Niche mechanisms that promote coexistence result from trait differences that reduce niche overlap and thus reduce competitive interactions allowing stable coexistence. The relative importance of niche differentiation versus neutral mechanisms for driving community patterns is hotly debated in ecology. It is likely that in natural communities coexistence mechanisms include both processes which are determined by how similar or different two species are to one another. The degree of differentiation or perhaps evolutionary distance may be a surrogate to understand which species can coexist and under what mechanism. In this research project I will be analyzing published competition experiments to see if phylogenetic relatedness can predict which species are able to coexist and the mechanism of coexistence. 	2007	2009524:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	13	11	0.028571429	0.152380952	0.00952381	0.038095238	0.095238095	0.066666667	0.038095238	0.038095238	0.019047619	0.047619048	0.19047619	0.019047619	0.066666667	0.095238095	0.085714286	0.00952381	0	0	0.016260163	0	0.008130081	0.008130081	0.040650407	0	0	0	0	0.008130081	0.113821138	0.056910569	0	0	0.008130081	0	0	0.008130081	0.081300813	0	0	0.008130081	0.008130081	0.024390244	0	0.016260163	0	0.024390244	0.024390244	0	0	0.024390244	0.008130081	0	0.040650407	0	0	0	0.016260163	0	0.008130081	0.008130081	0.008130081	0	0.032520325	0	0.016260163	0.097560976	0	0.008130081	0.024390244	0	0.032520325	0	0	0	0	0	0.016260163	0	0	0	0	0.008130081	0	0.016260163	0.032520325	0	0.024390244	0	0.032520325	0	0	0	0	0.008130081	0.008130081	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.024390244	0.024390244	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12285	" ;Tilman, David; "	The causes of biodiversity and the threats to its persistence	 My NCEAS research focuses on two markedly different aspects of biodiversity. The first are the underlying causes of earths amazing biodiversity. The tree of life which now contains on the order of 10 million species was founded about 3 billion years ago by a single ancestral species. The patterning of lifes subsequent diversification has the potential to provide profound insights into the forces that shaped the life histories morphologies physiologies behaviors and ecologies of both extant and extinct species. I will focus on the implications of one aspect of this patterning the near universal occurrence of competitive coexistence among competing species for at least the past 60 million years. When viewed in the light of current competition theory this observation suggests that all of life has been bound to a universal competitive tradeoff surface. I will dedicate much of time at NCEAS reviewing and synthesizing the relevant paleontological and current ecological literature and related competition theory. The second biodiversity issue focuses on the threats to biodiversity posed by land conversion and climate change. The 50 PeRcEnT increase in global human population and the 140 PeRcEnT increase in per capita global consumption projected for the coming 50 years have the potential to double global food and energy use. If cereal crop yields are unable to double in this period as seems likely the unmet demand for food is likely to be met by converting native forest and grassland to agriculture. Similarly demand for biomass for production of biofuels could also greatly increase the rate of deforestation and if done poorly might not provide any greenhouse gas emission benefit but rather lead to accelerated emissions. My goal at NCEAS is to compile and analyze the global data sets needed to better forecast the potential magnitudes of such food and biofuel effects on habitat destruction greenhouse gas release and loss of biodiversity and to propose solutions to this problem. 	2008	2008579:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	18	11	0.16	0.16	0.08	0.04	0.04	0	0.04	0	0	0	0.2	0.16	0.08	0	0.04	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.142857143	0	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0.071428571	0.017857143	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.053571429	0	0	0	0.035714286	0.017857143	0.035714286	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.035714286	0.071428571	0.071428571	0	0	0	0.017857143	0	0.017857143	0.017857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017857143	0.035714286					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12460	" ;Grant, Bruce; Mourad, Teresa; Gram, Wendy; "	 Engaging undergraduate students in ecological investigations using large public datasets 	 The Ecological Society of America (ESA) in close partnership with NEON Inc. will facilitate a distributed seminar to focus on examining effective student activities and assessment strategies for using large public datasets in the classroom.

However the movement of animals through a landscape can have strong impacts on the competitive coexistence of various plant life history strategies and the distribution of resources can alter animal movement patterns. Accordingly animal behavior and plant community dynamics can be inextricably linked by the influence of animal movement on the composition of plant communities and in the case of herbivores the effects of plant community composition on animal movement. For disturbance generating herbivores the link between the animal movement patterns and plant community composition is particularly strong because the animals foraging success is dependent on the composition of the plant community and the animals movement generates disturbances that can profoundly alter the competitive balance among plant species. Disturbance generating herbivores are of additional interest because of their strong effects on the physical environment. For example the tunneling behavior of pocket gophers can increase the heterogeneity of soil nitrogen phosphorous and carbon at the soil surface but soil mixing will decrease vertical variability. In addition the burrowing activity of gophers will lower soil bulk density and increase water infiltration temperature and litter decomposition rates. Pocket gopher activity is also a major force determining the rates of soil movement on hillslopes. In my research I am using a variety of modeling techniques to examine the interactions between the behavior of disturbance generating animals the structure of the associated plant community and the ecosystem processes that result from this interaction. These models range from spatially explicit movement models to analytical models of animal energetics and soil erosion. This modeling work is closely coordinated with a series of field experiments designed to test the predictions in the California grassland system. This system is of particular interest because of the high density of pocket gophers and their large apparent impacts on plant community composition and soil nutrient and water flux. In addition the outcome of these studies is of profound conservation interest because of widespread invasion of California native grasslands by exotic annual species. 	1997	2004609:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	11	0.012345679	0	0.135802469	0	0.12345679	0.012345679	0.086419753	0.024691358	0.024691358	0.012345679	0.419753086	0.024691358	0.024691358	0.024691358	0.037037037	0.037037037	0	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0	0.009345794	0.028037383	0.056074766	0.037383178	0	0.037383178	0.009345794	0.028037383	0	0	0	0.018691589	0.009345794	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0	0.009345794	0	0.009345794	0	0	0.261682243	0.158878505	0.009345794	0.009345794	0.037383178	0	0	0	0	0.028037383	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0.037383178	0	0.009345794	0	0.009345794	0	0.037383178	0.018691589	0.009345794	0	0	0.018691589	0	0	0.018691589	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0.009345794	0	0	0	0	0.009345794					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12541	" ;Byrnes, Jarrett; "	Linking network theory and biodiversity ecosystem function research: Topology modifies the consequences of species loss for the flow of energy and nutrients within food webs	 Over the past decade the field of biodiversity ecosystem function research has sought to understand the consequences of declines in species diversity due to human activities. The field has yielded many robust conclusions regarding the consequences of plant species loss for primary production and nutrient cycling. It has not however arrived at many generalities regarding the consequences of species loss at higher trophic levels for the flow of energy and nutrients through food webs even in the most simplified of experimental systems. Nor do we have a strong idea of the consequences of extinction in food webs of real world complexity. This lack of understanding is due to extinction altering not just the number of species in a food web but also degrading the network structure of feeding connections between species. I propose uniting biodiversity ecosystem function research with food web network theory to better understand the consequences of species loss for the efficiency of trophic transfer within food webs. I propose developing a unified theoretical framework that examines the consequences of species loss in the context of food web network structure. I will then examine how real world complexity alters the dynamics of trophic transfer by applying this framework to multiple long term community data sets. Lastly I will perform a meta analysis of published food web manipulations to examine how the topology of even simplified experiments can influence the dynamics of resource use. The results of this research will therefore fill a critical gap for managers in predicting the consequences of consumer species extinction in nature. 	2010	201297:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	59	11	0.050847458	0.016949153	0	0	0.06779661	0.016949153	0.118644068	0.033898305	0.101694915	0.101694915	0.406779661	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.016949153	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0.025974026	0	0.012987013	0	0.012987013	0.025974026	0.012987013	0	0	0.064935065	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0.064935065	0	0	0.103896104	0.12987013	0	0.012987013	0.038961039	0.025974026	0.038961039	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.025974026	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0.272727273	0	0	0	0.012987013	0.025974026	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012987013	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2154	" ;Elser, James; Fagan, William; "	Ecological stoichiometry of plant herbivore interactions	 We propose a working group to investigate how the ecological stoichiometry of plant herbivore interactions influences community dynamics in terrestrial and aquatic habitats. The relative availability of the elements carbon C nitrogen N and phosphorous P in autotrophic resource species in comparison with the relative demand for those elements in the body tissues of consumer species is believed to underlie major aspects of community organization in pelagic systems. Similar stoichiometric perspectives are rarely applied in studies of terrestrial plant herbivore systems even though suitable data exist on which to base preliminary syntheses. We seek to investigate how the stoichiometry of primary producers and herbivores compares between aquatic and terrestrial systems and how differences between habitats scale as functions of consumer body size phylogeny and specific growth rate.

Its participants have made recent advances in theory which link together two or more types of sampling curve. The group has four phases. In the first and second phases we will put the state of the art into the context of a framework that identifies two types of distortion of a basic sampling curve: the island model and the landscape model. In the third phase we will use this framework to combine the approaches of the island and landscape models into unified theory. In the fourth phase we will explore the practical implications of a unified theory for conservation.

While in principle the sources transmission and consequences of temporal variability can be quantified using fossil LTER or simulation approaches to date few studies have explicitly integrated insights from these complementary strategies. Consequently this project seeks funding to address three goals: a) calibrate high resolution paleoecological records with monitoring time series to quantify the degree to which fossil records accurately record observed ecological variability; b) test the hypothesis that the disturbance of ecosystems by increasing mass or energy transfer causes increased temporal variability of lake ecosystems and; c) develop a novel model that links modern ecological processes in lakes with the formation of sedimentary records.

Synthesizing data from background and mass extinctions in U.S. Coastal Plain mollusks	 Ecological studies suggest that rare taxa are more likely to go extinct than abundant ones but the relationship between rarity and extinction in the fossil record has received surprisingly little attention. The purpose of this research is to examine the link between rarity (defined here to include mean abundance spatial and temporal variability in abundance geographic range and habitat specificity) and extinction during both background and mass extinction intervals in the Cenozoic record of U.S. Coastal Plain mollusks. The questions I will address include: (1) Are rare taxa more likely to go extinct? (2) Does the relationship between rarity and extinction differ in mass versus background extinction intervals? and (3) Does selectivity differ according to metric of rarity? To accomplish this I will synthesize previously processed but unpublished abundance habitat and spatial occurrence data collected by myself and colleagues along with substantial data from the paleontological literature. This research represents one of the first attempts to explore the relationship between fossil abundance and extinction and will contribute substantially to our understanding of abundance and diversity in the Cenozoic of the U.S. Coastal Plain. 	2007	200854:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	6	12	0.183673469	0	0.06122449	0.020408163	0.102040816	0.020408163	0	0	0	0.040816327	0.020408163	0.448979592	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.020408163	0.040816327	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0.128571429	0	0	0.085714286	0	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0.085714286	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0.042857143	0	0	0.1	0	0.014285714	0	0.1	0.042857143	0	0	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0.057142857	0.042857143	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.085714286	0	0	0	0.014285714	0	0	0	0.085714286	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2088	" ;Marshall, Charles; Alroy, John; "	A sampling standardized analysis of phanerozoic marine diversification and extinction	 Our picture of global diversification and extinction on long time scales is mostly based on generalized data for Phanerozoic marine macroinvertebrates.

The working groups first meeting will immediately precede the beginning of my stay at NCEAS. During this meeting we will agree upon a database format and upon narrow goals for data compilation. I expect that contributed data modules will need to be uploaded or scanned checked and possibly augmented. Some of this work could be carried out by an undergraduate or technician working under my supervision. I also expect to correspond frequently with working group members as the project progresses and to be involved with planning the groups meetings. I am likely to work on designing new computer programs to carry out statistical analyses or on adapting my own existing programs for this purpose. 2) Completing new data modules that I have begun adding to my North American mammalian paleofaunal database. These include a lower first molar size measurement data set which I am using to estimate body mass; an upper cheektooth measurement data set which I will use to construct a size diet ecomorphospace that will distinguish herbivores carnivores and generalized insectivores omnivores; a species level phylogeny which I will use to study within and among lineage dynamics of evolutionary trends; and a specimen count data set which I will use to study trends in alpha diversity. All of these data sets will be compiled from published literature using my existing photocopy and reprint collection. However because some of the photocopies are incomplete I will need to augment them. Some of this work could be done at UCSB. Some of the more obscure references might have to be obtained by interlibrary loan although a stay of a few weeks at a facility having a major natural history library  the Smithsonian Institution; the University of California Museum of Paleontology) might be more efficient. 3) Developing new statistical methods and completing manuscripts. I am now working on several paleoecological projects that I expect to complete at NCEAS. These include methods that objectively identify   adaptive radiations    defined as phylogenetic groups that briefly experience rates of speciation far greater than those of other contemporary groups; an analysis of variation in speciation and extinction rates across the body size spectrum; a new method (  boxing and streaking  ) that describes non linear within lineage trends in pairs of correlated variables; an analysis of changes through time in the underlying dynamics of within lineage morphological evolution; the development of new unbiased statistics to describe within locality body mass distributions; and studies on the relationship between sampling intensity and alpha diversity at a local scale. Most of these projects relate to global climate change trends because such features as speciation and extinction rates alpha diversity local body mass distributions and the underlying dynamics of body mass and ecomorphological evolution all appear to shift in response to major environmental events. I may also continue my earlier work on diversity dynamics  by completing development of a new method for defining   evolutionary faunas  ; by studying the impact of intercontinental immigrants on turnover rates; by testing non linear diversification models) and on correcting diversity curves for sampling biases  by studying the distinctions between randomized subsampling based on faunal lists or on independently drawn taxonomic records).  	1998	2001132:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	26	13	0.04	0.12	0.08	0.04	0.08	0	0.08	0	0	0	0	0.08	0.28	0	0.04	0.16	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.08	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.16	0	0.04	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.08	0	0.04	0	0	0	0.08	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0.12	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.12	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0.04	0.08	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2224	" ;Thompson, John; Eldredge, Niles; "	Ecological processes and evolutionary rates	 In recent years the science of ecology has become increasingly directed toward questions at larger spatial and temporal scales.

The model should be able to predict plastic responses depending on the biotic and abiotic environmental conditions. The focus will be on reversible inducible defenses for Daphnia fast reversible behavior changes in vertical migration reversible physiological states like alertness slowly reversible morphological defenses like helmets and neckteeth formation and only partly reversible life history decisions. These reversible defenses appear simultaneously and in addition to constitutive defenses. The goal is find general conditions for the evolution of reversible plastic responses and to predict the intensity of each induced defense depending on the predation regime and its variability. 	2000	2001234:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	53	13	0.074626866	0.014925373	0.059701493	0.014925373	0	0.014925373	0.074626866	0.134328358	0.044776119	0.014925373	0.044776119	0.074626866	0.268656716	0.059701493	0.029850746	0.074626866	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.063063063	0	0.009009009	0.036036036	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.036036036	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009009009	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.027027027	0.099099099	0.018018018	0	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.027027027	0.036036036	0.369369369	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018018018	0.009009009	0.009009009	0.018018018	0	0	0	0.036036036	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0.018018018	0.009009009	0	0	0.018018018	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.009009009					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3900	" ;Murray, Jill; "	Bridging microbial and theoretical ecology to investigate cooperative strategies in bacteria	 Microbiologists have recently become equipped to identify the taxonomy of bacteria in situ understand phylogenetic relationships among groups and assay gene expression in individuals a development that parallels the explosion of natural history studies by general ecologists a century ago. One of the most exciting recent discoveries is that bacteria engage in extensive chemical signaling and density dependent behavior some of which appears to involve cooperative adaptive strategies. Paralleling early ecologists who studied cooperation microbiologists have not yet developed rigorous theory to test these ideas. Because theoretical and microbial ecology have developed with little interdisciplinary crossover microbiologists have not capitalized on the existing framework that is now available to investigate cooperation in higher organisms. The gap between empirical microbiology and quantitative theoretical ecology is a common theme that must be addressed as microbial natural history unfolds. I aim to work at the interface of the two fields; my goal is to learn if and how cooperative strategies play a role in the spatial distributions of bacteria in nature. This work will involve predictive numerical and simulation modeling of microbial foraging strategies and their resulting spatial patterns developed to enable discrimination amongst modes of selective pressure in future experimental tests. A mechanistic understanding of adaptive strategies in bacteria is essential to the understanding microbial food webs bacterial infections biogeochemical cycles and the bioremediation of contaminated habitats. The scaling of ecological theory to microscopic proportions will also benefit general ecology as long standing questions can be tested in microbial systems that can be modeled almost perfectly and tested over relatively vast spatial and temporal scales given the sizes and generation times of bacteria. 	2001	2003247:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	26	13	0.081632653	0.040816327	0.12244898	0	0.204081633	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0.081632653	0.285714286	0.040816327	0.040816327	0.06122449	0.122807018	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.035087719	0	0	0	0.105263158	0.140350877	0	0	0.01754386	0	0.035087719	0.210526316	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0.035087719	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0.01754386	0.01754386	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.035087719	0	0.01754386	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4221	" ;Donoghue, Michael; Webb, Campbell; "	Phylogenies and community ecology	 There exists a long history in ecology of examining communities in terms of their taxonomic structure  species genus ratios) with the expectation that this will shed light on both historical community assembly and contemporary ecological structure. Modern phylogenies now offer far more precision in the analysis of community taxonomic structure and an increasing number of studies are aimed at incorporating phylogenetic information into community ecology. Conversely studies of speciation are increasingly trying to incorporate information about the community context under which lineages separated. The time is ripe for a meeting that draws researchers together from ecology phylogenetics and paleobiology who have considered these issues but who may not otherwise interact. We thus propose an NCEAS working group focused on the question How can phylogenetic knowledge help answer community ecology questions and vice versa? Meetings will be structured to identify answers to this question and present datasets and analysis tools useful for exploring new avenues. Independent work between meetings would apply these methods and would be reported at subsequent meetings and in a final edited book. We expect that such a working group would catalyze the development of this promising field. 	2002	2002248:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	25	13	0.0625	0	0.0625	0.03125	0.03125	0.03125	0.0625	0	0.125	0.03125	0.03125	0.0625	0.40625	0	0.03125	0.03125	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.152173913	0.130434783	0.065217391	0	0	0	0	0	0.195652174	0.043478261	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.108695652	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02173913	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0	0	0	0.043478261	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4263	" ;Losos, Jonathan; "	Comparative study of adaptive radiation	 Despite intensive study over the past half century our conceptual understanding of adaptive radiation has advanced relatively little. A primary reason is that there has been no synthetic integrative study of adaptive radiation across different evolutionary lineages. The result is that our database on adaptive radiation is composed of a hodgepodge of studies. Disparities among studies in approach methodology and organisms mean that each study is unique and that as a result testing general hypotheses much less deriving new generalities is difficult. This working group will bring together experts in ecology and evolutionary biology with different taxonomic specialties to develop appropriate methods to conduct a comparative study of adaptive radiation. Group members will gather data from both their own studies and from other studies on related taxa thus amassing a large base of comparable data allowing for the testing of general questions about adaptive radiation as well as leading to the development of new approaches and questions. Members of current working groups focusing on related questions will be invited to participate in some of this working groups activities leading to mutually beneficial advances and synthesis. 	2001	2006259:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	36	13	0.057142857	0.028571429	0	0	0.057142857	0.028571429	0.028571429	0.057142857	0.085714286	0	0.028571429	0.028571429	0.4	0.085714286	0.057142857	0.057142857	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0.159090909	0.068181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0.113636364	0	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0.181818182	0	0	0.045454545	0	0.068181818	0	0	0.045454545	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.022727273	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.090909091	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		4600	" ;Becerra, Judith; "	Landscape coevolution of bursera plants and its herbivores	 In order to understand the macroevolutionary context of the ecology of plant herbivore interactions we need to have integrative studies that merge historical ecological and biogeographic information.

Recent attention has focused on evolutionary mechanisms in particular whether speciation rates may vary predictably with climate latitude whether such variation in speciation rates can account for higher species richness in tropical environments and what mechanisms might cause geographical variation in speciation rates. We propose to bring together an interdisciplinary team of ecologists evolutionary biologists and paleontologists to address the conceptual issues of how climate interacts with ecological and physiological processes to affect speciation rates. Our goal is to test whether speciation diversification rates vary with climate latitude using phylogenetic and paleontological data. However formidable challenges stand in the way of these tests. Therefore our group will work to identify ways to meet these challenges and to address methodological issues of how to use phylogenetic analysis as well as paleontological data to estimate rates of speciation and evolutionary diversification across geographical gradients. 	2005	2008406:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	17	13	0.048387097	0	0.080645161	0	0.112903226	0.016129032	0.016129032	0.048387097	0.016129032	0	0	0.032258065	0.419354839	0.064516129	0.112903226	0.032258065	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04	0.146666667	0.013333333	0.16	0	0	0.106666667	0.013333333	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.04	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0.066666667	0.066666667	0	0	0	0	0	0.066666667	0.04	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0.013333333	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10626	" ;Urban, Mark; Leibold, Mathew; "	Evolutionary and ecological sorting in space	 The last fifteen years have witnessed an increasing realization that ecological dynamics operating at coarse spatial scales have important ecological consequences. One of the more exciting ideas that has ensued is the   metacommunity   a concept that has contributed significant insights about population community and ecosystems ecology. To date however the metacommunity concept has been evaluated in a purely ecological context. Nevertheless close parallels and obvious interrelations exist between ecological and evolutionary dynamics at multiple spatial scales. Mounting evidence suggests that evolutionary dynamics can occur on time scales similar to those involving ecological dynamics. If so metacommunity and evolutionary dynamics may interact strongly. Yet we are only now beginning to understand this interaction. While metacommunity ecology will continue to contribute interesting insights about a diverse array of ecological phenomena we foresee that these insights will soon be constrained by our limited knowledge about how ecological and evolutionary processes interact in metacommunities. We seek to bring together scientists from diverse backgrounds to synthesize current knowledge and generate new understanding about evolutionary and metacommunity dynamics. We intend to 1) develop and refine an evolving metacommunity framework 2) explore the potential for emergent dynamics by incorporating evolution into existing metacommunity models; 3) evaluate how multi species interactions impact community evolution and dynamics; and 4) develop tools to test and apply the theory. The proposed synthesis of evolutionary and metacommunity theory promises to improve our understanding of species coexistence and provide strategies for preserving biodiversity and controlling rapidly evolving pests and pathogens. 	2006	2008407:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	20	13	0	0.033333333	0.1	0	0.166666667	0.016666667	0.233333333	0.016666667	0.033333333	0	0.033333333	0	0.366666667	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.04109589	0.01369863	0.02739726	0	0.191780822	0.02739726	0.01369863	0.205479452	0.01369863	0	0	0.02739726	0.01369863	0	0	0.01369863	0	0.01369863	0	0.02739726	0.068493151	0	0	0	0.02739726	0.082191781	0	0	0.01369863	0	0.01369863	0.02739726	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.02739726	0.01369863	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0.01369863	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		10641	" ;Urban, Mark; "	Interaction traits and metacommunity gene flow	 The metacommunity framework is stimulating novel predictions about community dynamics by considering both local species interactions and regional migration.

However few empirical generalizations have emerged about how landscape connectivity and community heterogeneity govern trait distributions of interacting species in metacommunities. Toward this end I am synthesizing data on variation in interaction traitsthose characters that shape the outcomes of interspecific encountersto explore relationships between trait distributions community structure and landscape connectivity. Using assimilated data on natural and common garden studies of interaction trait variation I then plan to evaluate interaction trait variation attributed to gene flow and community composition as conditioned on species dispersal abilities and generation lengths. Results will be used to inform rapidly advancing theories on evolution in metacommunities. 	2006	2008539:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	26	13	0.078431373	0.058823529	0	0.019607843	0.176470588	0.019607843	0.058823529	0.058823529	0.058823529	0.019607843	0	0.058823529	0.392156863	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0.041666667	0	0.180555556	0	0.069444444	0	0.055555556	0.027777778	0.013888889	0.083333333	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.222222222	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0.013888889	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12306	" ;Melian, Carlos; "	 Unifying niche neutral theories of molecular community and network evolution 	 A long discussed and unresolved question in ecology and evolution is to determine the mechanisms that originate and set an upper limit to diversity in ecosystems. Ecological and evolutionary views have focused on the mechanisms that enable or constraint species coexistence genetic variation and the genetics of speciation respectively but a unified theory of biodiversity linking those approaches in the same framework is still missing. Classic and current models of diversity have recently opened and reinvigorated the search for evolutionary and ecological patterns in a unified framework. At NCEAS I intend to work towards a unified theory of biodiversity by modeling multiple biological levels and spatial scales using novel computational and analytic approaches. I will also test these models with the huge amount of data on multiple levels and scales collected and meticulously catalogued that is becoming available for scientific analysis. In particular I will integrate neutral theories of molecular and species diversity by linking ecological interactions to explicit mechanisms of speciation by implementing models of evolving graphs at molecular and ecological levels. This will allow me to study how interacting graphs at multiple biological levels generate and alter diversity and better understand the evolution of diversity at different biological levels under neutral or natural selection. Finally these models will allow the linking of the origin evolution and coexistence of diversity to molecular sexual and trophic behavior at ecological and evolutionary scales. 	2008	2010542:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	53	13	0.025316456	0.037974684	0	0.012658228	0	0.037974684	0.037974684	0.025316456	0.227848101	0.012658228	0.037974684	0.037974684	0.392405063	0	0	0.113924051	0	0.008403361	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.016806723	0	0	0.025210084	0.025210084	0.016806723	0	0	0	0	0.008403361	0.016806723	0.008403361	0	0.008403361	0	0	0.033613445	0	0	0	0	0	0.142857143	0.016806723	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.033613445	0.008403361	0	0	0	0	0.008403361	0.008403361	0.008403361	0.025210084	0.008403361	0	0.352941176	0.016806723	0.016806723	0.008403361	0.092436975	0	0	0	0	0	0.016806723	0.008403361	0	0	0	0	0	0.008403361	0.008403361	0.008403361	0	0	0	0	0	0.016806723	0	0.008403361	0	0	0.008403361	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12316	" ;Wright, Ian; Green, Jessica; Bohannan, Brendan; "	Biogeography of Microorganisms: From Taxonomy to Traits	 Microorganisms represent the vast majority of Earths biodiversity and they play a crucialrole in nearly every process of environmental importance yet only recently have we begun to understandthe distribution of microbial life. The field of microbial biogeography has grown enormously in the past 5 years in large part due to the influence of a previous NCEAS working group. The study of microbialbiogeography initially adopted a taxonomic approach focusing on sequence signatures to identify groupsof microorganisms and using these signatures to reveal patterning in microbial biodiversity. These studies revealed classic biogeographical patterns such as the species area relationship and isolation by distance. However the field of biogeography is changing. There is a resurging interest in understanding patterns in the distribution of not only taxa but also the traits those taxa possess. Patterns in trait variation can be used to understand complex phenomena including why organisms live where they do how manytaxa can coexist in a place and how they will respond to environmental change. Technological advancessuch as environmental genomics place microbial ecology in a unique position to move trait based biogeography forward. The proposed working group will bring together microbiologists who are gathering microbial biodiversity and trait data with general ecologists who are developing theory toexplain and predict patterns of trait variation. The group will identify important traits in microbial biodiversity data develop predictions regarding the distribution of such traits and document patterns in trait based microbial biogeography. The products of the proposed working group will not only benefitthe general studies of ecology microbiology and biogeography. They will also contribute to our understanding of the response of ecological systems to environmental change and will provide importantfoundational knowledge that can guide microbial bioprospecting the search for biomolecules of pharmaceutical agricultural and industrial importance.

An Investigation of Community Level Ecological Correlates of Rapid Diversification in Replicate Temperate Angiosperm Genera 	 Processes behind patterns of angiosperm biodiversity in temperate regions are little understood. Further we do not know whether particular communities that currently support relatively high temperate biodiversity are the same communities that promote the evolutionary process of diversification  speciation). I propose to compare diversification rates within selected angiosperm genera that inhabit a range of temperate communities using published phylogenies and sequence data focusing on clades in which nodes can be or have been dated. I will then map habitat and community characteristics that have been hypothesized to be general factors promoting rapid diversification. I will apply method of moments estimators of diversification rates (using a stochastic birth and death model of diversification) both within and between selected genera to look for correlations between recent rapid divergence within clades and characteristics of habitat or community type occupied by those clades. Previous studies of diversification processes have targeted particularly diverse clades or communities and then attempted to draw conclusions about which factors led to their respective high species numbers. However my proposed method will allow for more rigorous hypothesis testing and generalization of conditions promoting diversification by starting with a phylogenetically diverse array of genera and ecological conditions within which to compare habitat characteristics and diversification rates. Furthermore recent advances in estimating diversification rates will allow me to disentangle the relative effects of speciation vs. extinction on diversification rates. These methods have seldom been applied to diversification rates within less inclusive crown clades which may be the most relevant for understanding the processes of speciation and conservation of habitat features or communities that are most likely to be sites of current speciation and or extinction. 	2009	2012657:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	17	13	0	0.084745763	0.050847458	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.033898305	0.06779661	0.050847458	0	0.050847458	0	0.559322034	0	0.050847458	0	0.063492063	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0.015873016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.365079365	0	0.015873016	0	0	0	0.031746032	0	0	0	0.015873016	0.031746032	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.079365079	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0.047619048	0	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.015873016	0.031746032	0.015873016	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.031746032	0	0	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0	0.031746032	0	0	0	0	0.095238095	0	0	0	0.015873016	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12662	" ;Jones, Emily; Friesen, Maren; "	When is a mutualist a cheater? A synthesis of conceptual and data based perspectives on the causes and consequences of variation in mutualist quality	 Cheating is a fundamental yet fuzzy concept in the study of mutualism. If it is defined at all cheating is variously defined as obtaining rewards from a partner while reciprocating nothing reciprocating less than other mutualists or reciprocating less than is fair. In all cases cheating is considered a threat to the ecological and evolutionary stability of mutualisms; however the ambiguity of what is actually meant by cheating stands in the way of understanding how common and how severe cheating is across mutualisms. The goal of our working group is to bring together a diverse group of scientists with expertise in different mutualisms to achieve a consensus on how to define and measure cheating and mutualist quality in general. Specifically we aim (i) to develop a standard quantitative metric of cheating (ii) to compile data on partner quality from across systems than span the range of mutualisms and (iii) to use these products to generate insight into several outstanding questions in the evolutionary ecology of mutualism. By forging consensus between early and later career scientists working in multiple systems our working group has the potential to transform the study of mutualism from a collection of examples into a unified field. 	2012	201293:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	26	13	0.051282051	0.256410256	0.025641026	0	0.076923077	0	0	0.025641026	0.051282051	0	0	0.179487179	0.282051282	0	0.025641026	0.025641026	0	0.132075472	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.094339623	0	0.037735849	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.188679245	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0	0.037735849	0	0	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.056603774	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018867925	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.056603774	0	0.037735849	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2150	" ;Gittleman, John; McKinney, Michael; "	Phylogeny and conservation: Problems in the quantification of biodiversity	 We propose a working group to assess the usefulness of algorithms and quantitative approaches to measuring biodiversity in terms of taxonomic distinctiveness or independent evolutionary units.

For many flowering plants they move pollen between plants while foraging thereby contributing to: 1) fruit set and size 2) seed production and viability and 3) seedling vigor while 4) enhancing genetic diversity of plant populations. Is this essential ecosystem service in jeopardy? It could be if human activities are causing widespread declines in pollinator abundance or accelerated rates of extinction. Declining abundance would soon translate into less frequent flower visitation and abrupt or gradual diminution of seed and fruit production. Depauperate pollinator faunas offer less redundancy to buffer fruit and seed set against the inevitable and sometimes chaotic population swings of individual pollinator species with repercussions for animal species and humans dependent on regular production of those plants and their seeds fruits for food. This 3 day workshop will have two objectives. First we will summarize the credible evidence for long term human influences on native pollinating insects and the fruits of their pollination services at local and global scales. Second we will evaluate the promise and practicality of strategies for filling gaps in that knowledge through studies employing 1) extant or readily obtained data sets (short term research) and 2) long term monitoring of inadvertent or purposeful experiments. 	1999	1999196:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	14	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.75	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2880	" ;Reichman, O.; "	Los Marineros.

For example the detection of strong associations between habitat soil quality seed mass life form dispersal mode and other life history traits has shed light on the selective forces  light availability and disturbance) that influence the evolution of these attributes within and among taxa. Virtually all investigators of plant communities have used this approach on single community level data sets compiled by their own research group (flora of Queensland various sites analyzing pooled data British flora pooled). Relatively few researchers have evaluated data sets including information from more than one community three Neotropical communities five temperate floras tropical vs. temperate floras). In the proposed NCEAS working group we will bring together a group of community ecologists and evolutionary biologists to use community level data to address two sets of questions that depend on the joint analysis of multiple data sets. Because these questions require the analysis of both pooled and separate community level data we have selected participants who have independently collected similar data in ecologically similar plant communities. One important objective of this proposal is to develop statistical approaches and to offer suggestions for analyses that other investigators will find useful for the ecological and evolutionary interpretation of community level data. We propose to bring to NCEAS investigators representing seven neotropical rainforest locations (Los Tuxtlas Mexico; Chajul Mexico; La Selva Costa Rica; Mabura Hill French Guyana; BCI Panama; Tambopata Wildlife Reserve and Manu National Park Peru). Collectively data sets currently available from well monitored one to fifty hectare plots in these locations include information on seed size seedling demography survivorship growth rates growth form reproductive phenology dispersal mode adult abundances and or size distributions of hundreds of plant species. Not all data are available for all sites and species but we have identified a set of questions and hypotheses to which these data are well suited. Naturally we fully expect the working group to identify additional theoretical and applied questions to be addressed. To conduct cross community studies of ecological and evolutionary patterns we have chosen to focus on the tree species of Neotropical moist forest communities for several reasons. First the adaptive significance of life history and functional traits is strongly dependent on environment. For example the role of seed size in seedling establishment is quite different in open and xeric environments than in the light limited mesic forest understory. Similarly the ecological factors influencing community structure vary across contrasting environments. By focusing on tropical forests we can assess the generality of adaptive hypotheses across communities and test evolutionary hypotheses regarding species differentiation in relation to life history under broadly similar conditions. Secondly in some cases there are strong floristic affinities among Neotropical forests  the dominant genera or families of trees are shared among sites). This facilitates tests of evolutionary hypotheses because we can extract data on diverse groups of closely related species in different communities. In comparisons of New World and Old World forests such analyses of closely related species  congeners) are often difficult or impossible. The timing is right to develop a joint concerted effort to analyze cross community data to detect ecologically and evolutionarily significant patterns and processes. First a number of research groups have successfully constructed data sets each characterizing hundreds of species but there currently exists no coordinated data set to allow the comparative analysis of these data across communities. Second theoretical and empirical work in the analysis of comparative data have increased our understanding of the value of methods for incorporating phylogenetic information into the quantitative study of multivariate data sets. Third phylogenies describing inter and intra familial relationships are now available for many tropical taxa allowing the use of phylogenetically independent contrasts that can assist in the detection of: (a) traits associated with high rates of diversification (b) the correlated evolution of multiple traits and (c) the joint evolution of traits and habitat requirements.

The distribution of strategies within a forest affects community structure and dynamics including successional patterns of species turnover and biomass accumulation spatial patterns of species occupancy and resilience to disturbance of various kinds. Landscape scale variation in factors such as the length of the growing season nutrient availability and disturbance regime influences the distribution of tree life history strategies found within local communities. I propose to use new analytical techniques to estimate the distribution of life history strategies within communities from existing data on tree species composition and species characteristics for as many tropical and temperate forests as possible. Then I will analyze differences in the distribution of life history strategies between communities and their associations with climatic and other factors. In parallel I will continue theoretical work on the evolution of life history strategies within communities. The overall objective is to contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of tree life history strategies within and among communities and of the implications for forest structure and dynamics. 	2002	2003296:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	82	14	0	0.044776119	0.179104478	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.014925373	0.059701493	0.029850746	0.089552239	0.029850746	0.074626866	0	0.089552239	0.328358209	0.014925373	0.014925373	0	0.041666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0	0.027777778	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0.027777778	0.013888889	0.027777778	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0.055555556	0.111111111	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0.013888889	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0.013888889	0.013888889	0.013888889	0.027777778	0	0	0.069444444	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.125	0	0.013888889	0	0.069444444	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6140	" ;Kinnaird, Margaret; O'Brien, Timothy; "	Functional relationships of Asian Hornbills in changing forest landscapes	 Birds and mammals are important seed dispersers and pollinators in tropical rainforests and are increasingly threatened by deforestation and hunting. The use of minimum viable populations as targets for conservation may be insufficient to assure the delivery of ecological services such as seed dispersal. Hornbills (Family Bucerotidae) are a distinctive African and Asian bird family inhabiting savannahs dry forests and rainforests of Sub Saharan Africa and India eastward to the Solomon Islands. In Asia hornbills are largely frugivorous forest birds and important dispersers of seeds of rainforest trees.

Recently the study of liana ecology has increased substantially throughout the tropics; however methods for collecting liana data are only rarely consistent and there is little comparability in liana abundance biomass diversity composition or community dynamics across large areas of the tropics. Until these data sets are combined and synthesized many large scale questions on the ecology of lianas will remain unanswered. We propose an NCEAS Working Group to standardize combine and synthesize the many liana data sets from research groups around the world. In doing so we will compile a pan tropical data set with which we can answer specific questions about the contribution of lianas to forest diversity and biomass worldwide as well as the pan tropical distribution of many important liana taxa. Four main goals will be addressed during two Working Group Meetings and the intervening year. (1) Establish logical and useable guidelines for censuses of lianas given different research goals. (2) Assemble and synthesize preexisting data sets on liana stem diameter abundance and diversity using empirically derived correction factors to generate a uniform pan tropical data set on lianas. (3) Estimate liana biomass at the whole forest and regional levels using new and substantially more robust stem diameter to biomass equations. (4) Create standard systematic databases and maps of the geographic distribution of liana taxa and maps of liana hotspots to identify conservation priorities. 	2005	2006499:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	34	14	0.051724138	0.051724138	0.224137931	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0.017241379	0.068965517	0.051724138	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0.396551724	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.031914894	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.021276596	0	0.127659574	0	0.010638298	0.010638298	0	0	0	0.042553191	0.063829787	0.021276596	0.010638298	0	0	0	0.042553191	0	0.010638298	0	0.010638298	0	0	0	0	0.159574468	0	0.010638298	0	0	0	0	0	0.010638298	0	0	0.021276596	0.021276596	0.053191489	0	0	0	0	0	0.021276596	0	0.010638298	0	0.010638298	0	0.095744681	0	0.021276596	0.010638298	0.021276596	0	0.010638298	0	0.085106383	0	0	0.021276596	0	0	0.010638298	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12147	" ;Townsend, Alan; Cleveland, Cory; "	Revisiting nutrient limitation in tropical forests	 Tropical forests have enormous ecological and societal significance. They are home to exceptional biological diversity (including humans) they profoundly affect a suite of globalscale processes and unfortunately they are experiencing myriad effects of global environmental change. Yet our understanding of basic ecosystem processes such as nutrient limitation in the tropics lags far behind many temperate and high latitude ecosystems and those data that do exist have not been thoroughly synthesized. In many respects this deficit results from a scarcity of data but more from the fact that the tropical rain forest biome is extraordinarily complex. Tropical forests present many unique challenges to resolving questions about nutrient limitation including the potential for limitation by multiple elements across both small and large spatial scales. Despite these challenges all confirmed participants of our proposed NCEAS workshop believe that we are now at the point where a productive synthesis of data describing tropical nutrient cycling and limitation can and should be undertaken and that this endeavor has the potential to generate a suite of valuable products that will be of broad utility to ecologists biogeochemists and to society as a whole. We therefore propose an NCEAS workshop that assembles ecologists geologists and ecosystem modelers that collectively represent five continents and all major tropical regions to pursue three goals: 1) assemble a database and synthesize data collected using a variety of techniques to assess nutrient limitation in tropical rain forest ecosystems; 2) perform a metaanalysis of both above and below ground tropical nutrient limitation; and 3) further the development of conceptual and analytical ecosystem models that can better predict the fate of tropical forests in a rapidly changing environment. Our ultimate goal is to take full advantage of the NCEAS model ranging from the opportunity to pursue the basic processes of data and conceptual synthesis to the use of ecoinformatics resources that are unique to NCEAS to advance our understanding of the nature of nutrient limitation in tropical forests. The time is right for a thorough synthesis and given the importance of tropical forests to global biogeochemistry and to society as a whole the potential value of such an effort is high. 	2008	201353:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	22	14	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2087	" ;Semmens, Brice; "	Los Marineros: A Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary Program in Partnership with the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History		1998	1999591:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	64	14	0.024590164	0.106557377	0.016393443	0.016393443	0.229508197	0	0.049180328	0.06557377	0.090163934	0.032786885	0.024590164	0.024590164	0.040983607	0.245901639	0.032786885	0	0	0.007407407	0	0.02962963	0	0	0	0	0	0.103703704	0.007407407	0.014814815	0.007407407	0	0.007407407	0	0	0.074074074	0	0.007407407	0.014814815	0.02962963	0	0	0.059259259	0.02962963	0.014814815	0	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0.133333333	0.007407407	0.007407407	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0.059259259	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.007407407	0	0	0.007407407	0.022222222	0.185185185	0	0	0	0.014814815	0	0.007407407	0	0	0	0	0.037037037	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0.007407407	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12475	" ;Comita, Liza; "	Determinants of relative species abundance: A cross continental comparison of tropical tree communities	 Determining the causes of commonness and rarity in ecological communities is essential for understanding how communities are structured and has important implications for biodiversity conservation. Identifying the determinants of species abundance has been particularly challenging in tropical forests which are characterized by both high species richness and high rarity. The objectives of the proposed study are to examine the determinants of and limits to species abundances in tropical tree communities and to investigate whether the processes shaping species relative abundance patterns differ among forests. Specifically I will address the following questions: (1) Do resource requirements and habitat preferences shape species relative abundances in tropical tree communities? (2) Is there a phylogenetic signal in species relative abundance patterns? and (3) Does local scale negative density dependence limit the abundance of tropical tree species? For the proposed project I will take advantage of existing standardized datasets from a global network of large forest dynamics plots coordinated by the Center for Tropical Forest Science (CTFS). CTFS possesses the worlds largest database on tropical tree dynamics with information on over 3.5 million individuals of 7500 species estimated to represent 10 PeRcEnT of all tropical tree species on earth. Using these data I will test hypotheses concerning patterns of commonness and rarity both within and among tropical tree communities. Specifically spatially explicit analyses of survival and growth will be used to identify drivers of species abundance patterns within diverse plant communities. Comparisons among sites will allow for an assessment of the consistency of these drivers among tropical forests that vary in biogeographic history species composition climate and disturbance regime. The proposed study will be among the most comprehensive cross site analyses of species abundance and will provide fundamental information about how diverse ecological communities are structured. An understanding of the similarities and differences among tropical forests sites will aid efforts to conserve and restore the incredible diversity of the tropics. In addition the project will yield multiple high profile publications and will result in publically available derived data products and a statistical package in R which will facilitate future research efforts by scientists around the globe. 	2010	2011660:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	34	14	0.181818182	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.011363636	0.193181818	0.011363636	0.011363636	0.022727273	0.102272727	0.022727273	0.022727273	0.022727273	0.215909091	0.113636364	0.022727273	0	0	0.043010753	0	0.11827957	0	0.096774194	0	0.010752688	0	0	0.010752688	0	0	0.032258065	0.010752688	0	0.021505376	0	0	0	0	0.010752688	0.010752688	0.021505376	0	0	0	0.010752688	0	0	0	0	0.193548387	0	0.021505376	0	0	0	0.021505376	0.010752688	0	0	0	0	0	0.021505376	0	0.010752688	0.021505376	0	0.010752688	0	0	0.010752688	0	0	0	0.010752688	0	0.010752688	0	0	0.010752688	0	0	0.075268817	0.021505376	0.010752688	0.010752688	0	0	0.010752688	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.096774194	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.021505376					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12665	" ;Hicke, Jeffrey; Fisher, Rosie; Anderegg, William; "	Synthesizing frontiers in modeling drought and insect induced tree mortality with climate change	 Forest ecosystems store large amounts of carbon and absorb nearly a quarter of human emissions of carbon dioxide annually.

This network has fundamentally changed the way forest biodiversity is studied. The fully mapped plots contain complete spatial locations of every single tree in a plot of typically 50 ha in size. Such spatial data are essential for inferring mechanisms of species coexistence. We seek to achieve two objectives. The first is to synthesize our understanding of the role that neighborhood spatial structure plays in mediating species coexistence in tree communities from the 1000 papers published for the large scale stem mapping forest plots. The second is to develop new methods for quantifying the spatial interaction of multispecies and the spatio temporal dynamics of tree point patterns. The proposed working group will contribute to a synthetic understanding of the maintenance mechanisms for tree communities from the spatial perspective and will further foster international collaborations in forest biodiversity study. 	2013	2013100:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	15	0	0.069767442	0	0.046511628	0.023255814	0.023255814	0.046511628	0.069767442	0.046511628	0	0.139534884	0.093023256	0.093023256	0	0.348837209	0	0.015625	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0	0	0.0625	0	0	0.03125	0.015625	0	0	0.03125	0.015625	0	0.015625	0	0	0.046875	0.015625	0	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0.109375	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0.015625	0.109375	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.09375	0	0	0	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.015625	0.015625	0	0.046875					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2161	" ;Miyanishi, Kiyoko; Johnson, Edward; "	Forest fires: Behavior and ecological effects	 A major problem in fire ecology has been the lack of understanding of fire behavior in any serious way by ecologists. A good proportion of papers in fire ecology give only cursory descriptions of the fire and seem always to lack any physical understanding of how fires affect individuals and populations. In recognition of this deficiency we have put together a book to be published by Academic Press whose intention is to bridge the gap between those who work on the physical and chemical processes of fire behavior and ecologists who are interested in the ecological effects of fire. In order for a book of this sort to be successful we feel a workshop is necessary in which the individual chapters are discussed and improved by interaction between the fire behavior specialists ecologists and resource managers. The resulting book will for the first time we hope provide a text which introduces foresters ecologists and resource managers to the contemporary understanding of fire behavior and explain how this understanding can be used to study ecological effects. We know of no other text published or planned that has this goal. We expect the text to potentially result in a major shift in research approaches taken by foresters and ecologists as well as in the kind of information that resource managers will require from fire researchers. 	1999	1999166:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	15	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0.068181818	0.068181818	0	0.068181818	0.045454545	0	0	0.090909091	0.022727273	0.613636364	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.036363636	0	0.054545455	0	0	0.036363636	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.109090909	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.181818182	0	0	0	0	0.490909091	0	0	0	0	0.018181818	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2291	" ;Turner, Monica; Dale, Virginia; "	 Comparing large infrequent disturbances: What have we learned? 	 The importance of natural disturbances in shaping landscapes and influencing ecosystems is now well recognized in ecology. Understanding of relatively small disturbances has increased rapidly but large infrequent disturbances such as volcanic eruptions hurricanes big fires tornadoes and floods have not been well studied.Whether very large disturbances are qualitatively different from numerous small disturbance remains an unresolved issue in ecology in part because of a paucity long term data on the effects of large scale disturbances. Within the past two decades several very large natural disturbances such as the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 the Yellowstone fires of 1988 Hurricane Hugo in 1989 the floods in the midwest in 1993 have received considerable post disturbance ecological research.

Yet intact native grasslands are one of the states most threatened ecosystems. The vast majority of Californias native grasslands were converted to urban or agricultural uses or have become dominated by alien species mainly annual grasses from the Mediterranean region. Moreover the relatively few native dominated grasslands that remain (even those in parks and reserves) appear to be disappearing rapidly often without clear causes. Work proposed here to integrate understanding of the distribution ecology status and trends of remnant native dominated grasslands in California would contribute to our understanding of the basic ecology of grasslands and improve the ability of conservationists and land managers to protect these rapidly disappearing natural communities. We will gather and analyze data relevant to understanding the following specific questions of California grasslands: What ecological factors control the distribution of the states remnant native dominated grasslands? What biotic and abiotic factors control the transitions between grasslands and other ecosystem types? At what rate are native dominated grasslands continuing to be lost? How do the answers to these questions vary along edaphic and climatic gradients and among different regions of the state? Many studies have been done on the ecology of grasslands in California and this previous work establishes that Californian grasslands differ ecologically in several crucial ways from those elsewhere in the United States and the world. First the invasion and replacement of native perennial bunchgrasses by Mediterranean annual species has been uniquely thorough in California. In California alien grasses appear to have outcompeted and replaced natives under a very wide range of conditions. Second most California grasslands are not as strongly successional as the prairie and old field systems of the midwestern and eastern US. The historical roles of fire and native ungulates in Californian grasslands are very poorly understood and may be largely irrelevant now given the widespread virtually complete conversion to exotic annual grasslands that has occurred across California. Third and following from the first two points the restoration of native grasslands in California is not as simple as reimposing a   natural   regime of fire or grazing. Despite substantial efforts at restoration Californian grassland ecologists have had very limited success in finding ways to recreate native dominated grasslands that resist invasion. We propose to expand on this previous work by analyzing and synthesizing data from across the state to determine how the structure function and dynamic trajectories of California grasslands vary along edaphic and climatic gradients. Ultimately we hope to assess whether the composition of remnant grasslands has reached an approximate steady state or alternatively where and how fast continued changes are occurring. Understanding the factors determining variation and driving change in California grasslands at a larger scale is essential for conservation and restoration efforts within the state and will provide valuable comparisons with similar work in other grassland communities. 	2000	2001214:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	15	0.027210884	0.102040816	0.047619048	0.027210884	0.040816327	0.006802721	0.013605442	0.020408163	0.013605442	0.027210884	0.006802721	0.013605442	0.054421769	0.12244898	0.462585034	0.013605442	0	0.033557047	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020134228	0	0.046979866	0.006711409	0.013422819	0	0	0	0.006711409	0	0	0	0.006711409	0.067114094	0	0	0	0.006711409	0	0	0.013422819	0.020134228	0.006711409	0.013422819	0.013422819	0	0.026845638	0	0	0	0	0.020134228	0.033557047	0	0	0.006711409	0	0.11409396	0.080536913	0.006711409	0	0.006711409	0.006711409	0	0.020134228	0	0	0.013422819	0	0.006711409	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.006711409	0.013422819	0	0	0	0.013422819	0.006711409	0	0	0	0.248322148	0	0	0	0.006711409	0.006711409	0	0	0.013422819	0	0	0.067114094	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3360	" ;Franklin, Jerry; "	Nature and role of biological legacies	 The complex interactions between disturbances and ecosystems are important current topics in ecological science. Disturbances of various types intensities frequencies and sizes have very different consequences in terms of intermediate impacts and recovery processes. One of the important variables among disturbances is the biological legacies types and quantities of organisms and organically derived structures and patterns that are left behind. As described by James MacMahon disturbances can be viewed as processes that edit out different components of existing ecosystems leaving behind the unedited the biological legacies. Important biological legacies include living organisms organically derived structures and organically generated spatial patterns. Organisms may persist as intact organisms seed banks spores and parts with a capacity to regenerate the whole organism. Structural legacies include dead trees logs coral and animal carcasses. Spatial patterns include chemical physical and microbial imprints on soils from specific species or communities. Strong spatial patterns also exist in disturbance intensity and therefore type and level of biological legacies at the level of the landscape as well as the patch. Unfortunately the scale and importance of biological legacies are not well understood or appreciated in ecological science nor is the diversity of impacts the   editing   process. Emphasis in text presentations on disturbance and succession almost always emphasize recolonization from outside of the disturbed area rather than surviving organisms. Structural legacies are almost never considered in classical presentations on succession. The early focus on old fields in studies of secondary succession may be one reason for the lack of attention to legacies as well as the emphasis on development of general theoretical models that often fail to consider the idiosyncratic nature of each ecosystem disturbance type and specific event. Studies of recent large scale disturbance events have increased the interest in biological legacies however beginning with research on ecosystem recovery following the Mount St. Helens eruption of May 1980. Other events such as the Yellowstone Fires of 1988 and Hurricane Andrew in 1992 contributed significantly to the continuing development of the concept. In 1996 the U.S. LTER Program convened a small workshop at Wind River Washington to discuss how the concept of biological legacies applies across a range of ecosystem types from forests to lakes. Nine scientists participated in this workshop. An outline some text and several tables were prepared for a definitive article on the concept of biological legacies but unfortunately has not been completed. More recently the U.S. LTER Program identified biological legacies as the topic for one of the sessions at the LTER 2000 meeting that is to be held on August 2 4 2000 at Snowbird Utah. This new forum provides an impetus and opportunity to complete the initial report and critique and expand the concept of biological legacies. However careful preparation is needed to fully realize the potential of this opportunity. I am requesting assistance from the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis in developing a fuller understanding of the concept of biological legacies the application of the concept to various types of disturbances and ecosystems and the diversity of ecological roles that such legacies can play. Specifically I am requesting: (1) the opportunity to utilize facilities at NCEAS during April and May 2000 in completing the report of the initial workshop; and (2) support for bringing together at NCEAS a small (7 10 members) working group on biological legacies to critique and expand the earlier concepts and to assist in planning the session for the LTER 2000 meeting. The working group would be a mix of individuals from the original workshop and other scientists representing ecosystem types  near shore marine) and topical areas not previously represented. Outcomes of this effort will include both a synthetic article on biological legacies for the peer reviewed literature  BioScience) and a book based upon presentations and discussions at the LTER 2000 session. 	2000	2000228:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	80	15	0.036764706	0.029411765	0.029411765	0.014705882	0.022058824	0.014705882	0.014705882	0.095588235	0.044117647	0.036764706	0.022058824	0.029411765	0.036764706	0.014705882	0.5	0.058823529	0.005681818	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.005681818	0	0	0	0	0.005681818	0	0.130681818	0.005681818	0	0	0.011363636	0.017045455	0.005681818	0	0	0.005681818	0	0	0.017045455	0.051136364	0.005681818	0	0	0	0.096590909	0	0.011363636	0	0.005681818	0	0.017045455	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0.005681818	0.034090909	0.022727273	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017045455	0	0	0.005681818	0.011363636	0	0	0	0	0.011363636	0	0	0.414772727	0	0	0	0.022727273	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3741	" ;Reichard, Sarah; McCullough, Deborah; Cavey, Joseph; "	 Pathways of non indigenous plant pest introductions: How exotic insects pathogens and weeds arrive in the United States 	 Non indigenous weeds phytophagous insects and plant pathogens have had dramatic effects on ecosystems in North America and threaten nearly half of all endangered species in the United States. Introductions of non indigenous species are expected to continue and will likely increase as global trade expands. The U.S. Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) is responsible for excluding non indigenous phytophagous insects plant pathogens and noxious weeds. Since 1985 APHIS personnel have maintained a database of non indigenous species detected at ports border inspection stations and airports. This database known as the Port Interception Network or   PIN   data exists on an aging mainframe computer in Maryland. Over 50 000 reports are entered into the PIN database annually. The PIN database which has not been made available to the public is unwieldy and queries must be carefully designed to extract appropriate data. APHIS personnel have used the PIN data for internal assessments and training but intensive and multidisciplinary analysis of these data has not been attempted. Detailed and intensive analysis of the entire PIN database will greatly increase our understanding of precisely how unwanted organisms are entering the United States. In addition results of our pathway analysis coupled with literature reviews should enable us to evaluate potential patterns or attributes of successful invaders. An interdisciplinary team of entomologists pathologists and botanists will analyze the PIN database. Our objectives are to: 1. Summarize historical trends in the groups of plant feeding insects and related arthropods plant pathogens and undesirable plants that arrive at the borders of the U.S.; 2. Evaluate potential associations or patterns that involve taxa from two or more groups; determine whether plant species or commodities are consistently associated with specific arthropod or pathogen introductions; 3. Identify the frequency that specific guilds or taxa arrive and the rate of establishment of members of those groups; 4. Determine whether attributes such as host breadth size of native range reproductive rate mating system dispersal method or other traits are related to the frequency of introduction or establishment of selected taxa. 	2001	2004322:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	31	15	0.028169014	0.056338028	0.084507042	0	0.028169014	0.014084507	0.028169014	0	0.112676056	0.028169014	0.042253521	0.028169014	0.028169014	0	0.352112676	0.169014085	0	0.036585366	0	0.036585366	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0.036585366	0	0.048780488	0	0.012195122	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0	0	0	0.341463415	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.036585366	0.12195122	0	0.024390244	0	0.036585366	0	0	0	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.048780488	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012195122	0	0	0.024390244					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7040	" ;Torchin, Mark; "	Using biological invasions to test predictions of population control by parasites	 Introduced species are a major threat to global biodiversity ranked second only to habitat loss. The damage caused by exotic species results from the high population densities and large body sizes that they attain in their new location. Escape from the effects of natural enemies is a frequent explanation given for the success of introduced species. Recently Torchin . demonstrated that introduced species are parasitized by half the number of parasite species compared to where they are native and that introduced populations are also less heavily parasitized (PeRcEnT infected) than native populations. However while parasites are ubiquitous and pervasive the extent to which parasites mediate invasions and result in increased ecological performance of introduced species has not been evaluated. Further the extent to which introduced parasites and pathogens are responsible for damage to native species has not been quantified. Using existing data I propose to extend a database which I developed for a NCEAS working group (Diseases and Conservation Biology) and employ a meta analysis to test several hypotheses which explore the role of parasites in biological invasions. Further by using biological invasions as natural experiments I will design this project to investigate a more fundamental question in ecology: How do parasites affect the distribution and abundance of their hosts? 	2003	2004338:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	23	15	0.195652174	0.152173913	0	0	0.086956522	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.043478261	0.02173913	0.065217391	0.043478261	0	0.239130435	0.130434783	0	0.019607843	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.176470588	0.039215686	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0.196078431	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0.019607843	0.019607843	0.078431373	0	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0.058823529	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0.039215686	0	0	0.078431373	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019607843	0.019607843	0.019607843	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		7961	" ;Drake, John; "	Risk analysis for alien species and emerging infectious diseases	 Undesirable alien species and emerging infectious diseases (of both wildlife and humans) are urgent environmental concerns.

In spite of these costs exotic species present unique opportunities to advance our conceptual understanding of ecological patterns and processes. By using exotic species as a vast array of natural experiments we can address questions at scales that would otherwise be non experimental and we can observe processes that have occurred repeatedly in the past but that have previously gone unrecorded. Indeed exotic species may present one of the best inroads available to understanding ecology evolution and biogeography. The goals of this working group are three fold. First to explore the insights that exotic species provide to fundamental conceptual issues in ecology evolution and biogeography. Second to provide a model for the budding field of invasion biology which currently is focused strongly on applied issues but which could be redirected to simultaneously study both applied and conceptual issues. Third to use the insights we gain to ecology evolution and biogeography to in turn improve our ability to manage and mitigate the damage caused by exotic species. To accomplish these goals we propose a novel model that includes the delegation of work prior to the first meeting of the working group; we have identified a motivated body of scientists who are ready to initiate this work. This approach should allow us to produce a great number of conceptual insights as well as a great number of important publications that will advance the study of ecological systems and our ability to effectively manage them. 	2004	2007345:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	31	15	0	0.096153846	0.192307692	0.096153846	0	0.057692308	0	0	0.038461538	0.019230769	0.038461538	0	0.019230769	0	0.384615385	0.057692308	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.018518519	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.037037037	0.240740741	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0.055555556	0	0	0.074074074	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0.12962963	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519	0	0	0	0	0.12962963	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018518519					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		8140	" ;Lodge, David; "	Biology and policy of invasive species	 Species transported by humans from one region to another nonindigenous species sometimes become invasive. That is they spread widely and some cause enormous environmental and economic damage. Cheat grass zebra mussels and West Nile virus are three of hundreds of examples of invasive species in the US. Over at least the last century increasing global trade and human travel have caused dramatic rises in both intentional and accidental introductions of nonindigenous species. Undoubtedly this trend will continue and perhaps accelerate as global commerce increases. Although ecologists have long recognized the phenomenon of invasive species only in recent years have they given it concentrated scientific attention. And only in the last decade have the societal costs and natural resource management challenges posed by invasive species received serious policy attention at the US federal and state levels. My project is to write a book entitled Biology and Policy of Invasive Species. The volume will synthesize the current scientific and policy situation of invasive species and recommend how interdisciplinary research and policy development might move forward. 	2004	2005363:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	31	15	0.028571429	0	0.028571429	0.028571429	0	0.028571429	0.085714286	0.028571429	0	0.028571429	0.114285714	0.057142857	0	0.057142857	0.457142857	0.057142857	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0.027027027	0	0	0.108108108	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.27027027	0.027027027	0	0	0.027027027	0.081081081	0.054054054	0	0.027027027	0.027027027	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0	0.054054054	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0.027027027	0	0.027027027	0	0.027027027	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		8980	" ;Orrock, John; "	Interactions between mammalian herbivores and associated plant communities	 The grasslands of California represent one of the most dramatic biological invasions in the world: 9.2 million ha (almost 25 PeRcEnT of the entire state) are dominated by non native plants.

Yet modeling efforts largely ignore fire in global vegetation and climate projections. Therefore I propose to synthesize published data on fuel production climate and ignition sources with reconstructed fire histories in order to investigate the determinants of fire frequency across scales and ecosystems. Rather than gauge how fire influences the biosphere I plan to assess the factors that control the global fire cycle. This fire centric approach will illuminate the biotic and abiotic factors that increase fire frequency.

This diverse group will assemble historical data and develop population models that capitalize on our knowledge of Allee effects stochastic dynamics and spatial ecology to formulate and optimize new strategies for eradicating alien species and for identifying conditions under which eradication is practical. 	2009	2011614:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	75	15	0.081632653	0.102040816	0	0.020408163	0.12244898	0.12244898	0.06122449	0.020408163	0.040816327	0.020408163	0.040816327	0.020408163	0.020408163	0	0.306122449	0.020408163	0	0	0.038461538	0	0.038461538	0	0	0.019230769	0	0.076923077	0.019230769	0	0	0.038461538	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0.057692308	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0.076923077	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.115384615	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0.019230769	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.096153846	0	0	0.269230769	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.019230769	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12567	" ;Moritz, Max; "	Fire as a Global Ecological Disturbance	 Fire affects a variety of biophysical patterns and processes but we generally lack an understanding of fires ecological influence at broad scales. Two key issues highlight this knowledge gap: 1) Fire is certain to alter species distributions as global climate change progresses yet most models of how species ranges may shift overlook this important ecological disturbance; and 2) Analyses of existing biodiversity patterns especially from continental to global scales typically ignore the possible influence of fire. To address these issues my sabbatical research will aim to synthesize current results on global patterns of fire climate and species distributions. This work should improve our understanding of fires direct and indirect influences on biodiversity where different species will be able to persist as climate changes and how to better incorporate fire into long term conservation planning. 	2010	2011622:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	80	15	0.051724138	0.103448276	0.103448276	0.068965517	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.034482759	0	0	0.051724138	0	0	0.086206897	0.431034483	0.034482759	0.041666667	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0.013888889	0.027777778	0	0	0.013888889	0	0.013888889	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0.041666667	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0.055555556	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.041666667	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0.013888889	0	0	0.013888889	0.013888889	0	0.333333333	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0.055555556	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12587	" ;Britton, Kerry; "	Plants for planting	 This working group will evaluate data availability and quality for an assessment of the costs and benefits of implementing changes to USDA Plants for Planting regulations to prevent the unintentional importation of invasive pests carried on plants into the United States.

Climate change and biological invasions are two of the primary causes of biodiversity loss and it has been hypothesized that these factors may operate synergistically in the future. We propose a working group composed of experimentalists and modelers whose objective will be to quantitatively evaluate the interaction between climate change and species invasions. First we will conduct the first cross ecosystem meta analysis of non native and native species physiological tolerances and impacts of changing climatic conditions on demographic rates. Our goal will be to address whether non natives are poised for greater success in future climate conditions. Second using information on current ranges and on physiological tolerances we will construct a combination of bioclimatic envelope models and mechanistic distribution models to compare changes in range sizes for non native and native species. Such integration between modeling techniques has rarely been attempted despite it being one of the most promising methods for advancing our understanding of the ecological consequences of climate change. Finally we will further integrate our meta analysis and modeling results to address the relative change in invasion impacts for target species with the goal of improving recommendations for conservation and management. The uncommon breadth and depth of our study will yield robust insights into how the spread and impact of invasive species will be altered by climate change. Specific results will inform estimates of the species and location specific risks of invasions which will support invasive species management decisions. Our working group is uniquely poised to make progress toward forecasting the effects of climate change on species invasions because our participants have access to a large quantity of high quality data and bring the theoretical and empirical expertise needed for the task. 	2011	201275:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	31	15	0.169811321	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.056603774	0	0	0.056603774	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.528301887	0.056603774	0.035714286	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0.023809524	0	0.011904762	0	0	0.035714286	0	0	0	0	0.023809524	0.023809524	0	0.023809524	0	0	0.011904762	0	0.023809524	0	0.011904762	0	0.333333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0.178571429	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.023809524	0	0	0.047619048	0	0	0	0.023809524	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.023809524	0	0	0.011904762	0.011904762	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.011904762	0	0.035714286	0.011904762	0.011904762	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2117	" ;Parker, Ingrid; "	Invasion biology: Toward a theory of impacts	 The past decade produced an impressive collection of books and edited volumes on   invasion biology  . These volumes brought together case histories of a large number of invasive exotic organisms from all taxonomic groups and invaded communities from all corners of the globe. In addition to compiling case histories this explosion of volumes produced a forum for the development of general observations and mostly verbal theory about the patterns and dynamics of invasions. Commonly noted was the lack of rigorous mechanistic experimental examples or tests of theory. In the years since the symposia that spawned these initial volumes researchers have gone beyond natural history and have begun investigating particular invasions in great biological detail and with more rigorous methods. In addition in part as a response to the general recognition of exotic species invasions as one of our most pressing environmental problems both researchers and agencies have begun compiling databases of introduced species.It is now time to regroup and figure out what weve learned. Because of the recent surge of empirical work we are in a much better position now than we were a decade and a half ago to move beyond arm waving and the time is right for a new synthesis. Our research will focus on successful invasions and ask whether it is possible to predict which invasions will have a large impact on communities and ecosystems? 	1998	2000121:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0.060810811	0.054054054	0.155405405	0.02027027	0.033783784	0.087837838	0.02027027	0.02027027	0.033783784	0.033783784	0.027027027	0.006756757	0.060810811	0.054054054	0.047297297	0.283783784	0	0	0.006024096	0	0.006024096	0	0	0	0	0.018072289	0	0.006024096	0.006024096	0.024096386	0	0.192771084	0.054216867	0.054216867	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.036144578	0	0.006024096	0	0.018072289	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.036144578	0	0.012048193	0	0.018072289	0.006024096	0	0.006024096	0.024096386	0	0	0.012048193	0.006024096	0	0.042168675	0.030120482	0.006024096	0.024096386	0	0	0.024096386	0.072289157	0.042168675	0	0	0.054216867	0.006024096	0.006024096	0	0	0.012048193	0.006024096	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.042168675	0.006024096	0.006024096	0	0	0	0.006024096	0	0	0.006024096	0	0.030120482	0	0.006024096	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2197	" ;Wilson, Mark; Real, Leslie; "	Global change and infectious disease	 A major element underlying many emerging and reemerging infectious diseases is environmental change. This may be manifested through direct and intentional landscape changes hydroelectric dams agricultural development projects irrigation urban expansion mining deforestation) indirect habitat changes that favor transmission  increased vector breeding sites evolution of virulence or enhanced contact with infectious agents) and the possibility that other indirect abiotic effects including climate change might alter the intensity or distribution of various diseases. A better understanding of these processes is needed for risk is to be understood and reduced and for outbreak forecasts are to be made accurate and credible. The goal of this sub group is to explore various associations between environmental change and specific infectious diseases that have strong environmental links by analyzing data sets with extensive and well documented temporal and or spatial variation.Specifically we propose to begin by analyzing two categories of infectious disease. The first is vectorborne disease. Within this category we focus on a mosquito borne anthroponosis human malaria which will be analyzed using data from various sites and sources throughout the world. Time series analysis and study of spatial patterns among cases and environmental variables will be undertaken using standard time series and GIS based statistical models. An attempt will be made to test hypotheses that are based in the biology of vectors human ecological relations with the environment and each other and climatic factors that influence transmission.Diarrheal diseases comprise the second category. Evolutionary theory and empirical studies indicate that diarrheal diseases evolve increased or decreased virulence in response to environmental changes. Specifically this work suggests that when waterborne routes of transmission are available natural selection will favor highly exploitative pathogen variants because in such environments the costs of exploitation are low. Even ill immobilized hosts can act as sources of infection because fecal material is removed and washed in water that can contaminate supplies of drinking water. Conversely if safe water supplies are provisioned we predict pathogens to evolve toward benignity. There exists a great amount of data in the literature and in unpublished records  located in ministry of health archives) that we propose to analyze to test this prediction. Our focus in this second category will be on the bacterial agents of dysentery because the inherent virulence of these agents varies at the species level and the frequencies of these species in human populations spans the length of time over which water supplies have been improved  over the past century). 	2003	2005122:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0.022058824	0.110294118	0.007352941	0.009803922	0.112745098	0.007352941	0.051470588	0.014705882	0.00245098	0.007352941	0.051470588	0.004901961	0.009803922	0.004901961	0.044117647	0.539215686	0.002710027	0.016260163	0	0	0.032520325	0	0	0.024390244	0	0.029810298	0	0	0.024390244	0	0	0.317073171	0.002710027	0.032520325	0	0.040650407	0.021680217	0.027100271	0	0.002710027	0	0.002710027	0	0	0.002710027	0.048780488	0.010840108	0.016260163	0.002710027	0	0.005420054	0	0	0	0.008130081	0.005420054	0.010840108	0.005420054	0.002710027	0.005420054	0.005420054	0.024390244	0.013550136	0	0.002710027	0	0	0	0.002710027	0.029810298	0.01897019	0	0.005420054	0.046070461	0	0	0.002710027	0	0	0.005420054	0	0.029810298	0.016260163	0	0.010840108	0.029810298	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010840108	0.010840108	0	0	0.002710027	0.010840108	0.016260163	0.002710027	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2198	" ;Holt, Robert; Dobson, Andrew; "	Infectious diseases and conservation biology	 Infectious diseases present a special challenge to conservation biologists: they form a largely unexplored component of biodiversity that from one perspective helps promote coexistence and diversity; at the other extreme there are several examples of pathogens contributing to the extinction of threatened and endangered species. This working group will examine three topics that are central to our understanding of the role pathogens play in conservation biology. Central to the theme of the workshop is the development of a quantitative understanding of how pathogens effect the dynamics of communities that contain more than one potential hosts species. Here we will primarily be concerned with developing empirical and theoretical analysis that examine the role that pathogens play in mediating the coexistence of potentially competing species (or in maintaining genetic diversity within a single host species). We will then examine whether the diversity of host species tends to either buffer or amplify disease outbreaks. In particular we will explore the ecological interactions between transmission route host diversity and pathogen persistence. This section of the working group will examine empirical data for a number of systems in which we can dissect the relative roles played by host abundance host resource utilization and host spatial distribution in determining rates of intra and inter specific transmission. In conjunction with these largely deterministic and analytical exercises we shall also examine data for epidemic outbreaks in small (endangered) populations. These analysis will allow us to develop stochastic models that determine the impact of pathogens on populations that are too small to sustain a long term persistent source of infection. In particular we will focus on examining the costs and benefits of intervention to prevent further spread of the disease particularly in the limiting case where small host population size always leads to the pathogens eventual extinction. Pathogens and infectious diseases create special problems for both the protection of endangered species and for the maintenance of biodiversity. There are several examples of cases where the introduction of a pathogen has produced a significant further decline in the numbers of an already threatened species (black footed ferrets hunting dogs in Serengeti endemic Hawaiian birds). In all of these examples the pathogens involved were ones that utilize common or domestic species as reservoir hosts. There is increasing evidence that species diversity per se may provide an important buffer that minimizes the impact of a pathogen on any individual host species pathogens. Paradoxically pathogens may also play a role in both maintaining biodiversity and in driving processes that lead to increases in local diversity (refs). This workgroup will focus on examining these problems by examining seven different ecological communities for which significant volumes of epidemiological data are also available. Each of the data sets provide important insights into at least one of our main research questions but we do not expect to apply all of the questions to each of the data sets. We are interested in addressing three general classes of questions: 1) What are the dynamics of a recently introduced pathogen in a small population? In particular how do deterministic and stochastic factors interact to determine the persistence and extinction of pathogens in small populations? In conjunction with this we will also examine how different types of pathogens contribute to further declines in the abundance of potentially endangered host species? 2) In pathogens that utilize a range of host species what roles do relative abundance susceptibility and overlap in spatial distribution play in determining interspecific rates of pathogen transmission? In particular how much does ecological information on the behavior and spatial distribution of potential host species complement aetiological information and allow us to identify species that are most likely to act as reservoir hosts for pathogens that provide a significant threat to rare or endangered species? 3) Does the diversity of species used by a pathogen tend to buffer or increase either its persistence or rate of spread? Under what conditions will a pathogen enhance the diversity of species that co exist in any community? Data sets that will or potentially could be used are: Question 1 (1) long term data sets on carnivores ungulates and their pathogens in the Serengeti; (2) data for a measles outbreak in mountain gorillas in Rwanda; (3) data for avian malaria in introduced and native bird species in Hawaii; Questions 2 and 3 (4) data for the ticks deer mice white tailed deer and Lyme disease in New England; (5) data for ticks Louping ill grouse sheep blue hares and deer in Scotland; (6) data for racoon rabies in the eastern United States (7) data for duck plague from the National Center for Wildlife Diseases Initially we shall use data sets 1 3 to address question 1. Data sets 4 7 will be used to examine questions 2 and 3. In each case we will examine empirical data for the dynamics of a specific pathogen this will be used as the basis for first constructing fairly general ecological epidemiological models. These will then be parameterized using the available empirical data. A variety of analysis will then be undertaken then examine sensitivity of the model to parameterization initial conditions and the presence of alternate hosts. We will also examine the consequences of modifying the transmission terms of the models in an attempt to examine how different methods of transmission might modify our conclusions. An important additional exercise will be the development of some stochastic simulation models for pathogens in small populations. These shall be used to examine whether intervention is likely to have a significant impact and how rapidly it needs to be applied in order to have an effect. This exercise will provide an important set of guidelines for veterinary workers and conservation biologists who frequently disagree on the relative value of disease intervention when dealing with endangered species. The main results of the workshop will be presented in a series of scientific papers which will provide a better understanding of three crucial problems in ecological epidemiology as applied to the management and conservation of endangered species. The first set of these papers will explore the dynamics of infectious diseases in small populations. The second will provide a deeper understanding of the role that ecological interactions play in mediating interspecific diseases transmission. While the third set will develop an understanidng of the role that biodiversity plays in buffering disease outbreaks for some pathogens. The beneficiaries of this will obviously be the participants in the workshop but we expect the additional community benefits to extend well beyond the marginal boosting of citation indices. There is a considerable need in both the wildlife veterinarian and conservation biology community for a coherent body of work that explains with specific examples the twin role that pathogens play threat and mediator of biodiversity. Thus we can expect the work we produce to be used not only for teaching purposes but also in helping inform government agencies and NGOs about how best to respond to parasites and infectious diseases in natural ecological communities. If we examine examples of the recent responses of NGOs and government agencies to challenges presented by infectious diseases we tend to find that ignorance has led to either extreme and irrational control measures or hard to substantiate ad hoc measures. (Examples bison and brucellosis toxin in Monk seals malaria in Hawaii). The least we can hope for from our workshop is to firmly refute the commonly held opinion that disease outbreaks are chance random events. If fairly lucky we should be able to provide a set of examples that illustrate the underlying deterministic nature of the ecology of infectious diseases while also illustrating the crucial and not entirely random role that stochastic forces play. Ultimately this will lead to the development of more rational policies for the management of pathogens in ecological communities. 	1999	2002123:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0	0.034482759	0.103448276	0	0	0.068965517	0.206896552	0.068965517	0.034482759	0	0	0	0	0	0.103448276	0.379310345	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.114285714	0.028571429	0.371428571	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.171428571	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.057142857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0.057142857	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.028571429	0.028571429	0	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2199	" ;Dobson, Andrew; Real, Leslie; "	Spatial ecology of infectious disease	 The ecology of infectious diseases is receiving increased attention from both public health officials and traditional population biologists. It is clear that the ability to predict and forecast disease outbreaks will require a greater understanding of spatial dynamics and the analysis of spatial patterns of spread. The goal of this Working Group is to analyze large spatial data sets of disease occurrence and spread drawn from natural agricultural and public health databases. By comparing the spatial ecology of disease across these different systems we hope to arrive at some basic generalizations about spatially dependent disease dynamics. 	1999	2002133:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	8	16	0.071428571	0	0.107142857	0	0	0.071428571	0	0	0.035714286	0	0.035714286	0	0.214285714	0.035714286	0.178571429	0.25	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0.111111111	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.055555556	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.111111111	0.083333333	0.027777778	0	0.027777778	0	0.083333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0.027777778	0	0	0.083333333	0.027777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.055555556	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0.027777778	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2225	" ;Hackett, Edward; "	Ecology transformed? A proposed working group to study new forms of scientific collaboration	 We propose to examine the organization functioning and products of selected NCEAS working groups placing them within the larger contexts of the disciplinary development of ecology and the emergence of new patterns of scientific collaboration. We would do this in two ways. First we would examine the characteristics and consequences of NCEAS working groups using interviews observations and examination of documents (such as publications proposals and participants vitae). Second we would organize a working group to study new forms of scientific collaboration placing the NCEAS experience within the context of the history of ecology and the contemporary experience of other fields of science. The group would include historians philosophers and social scientists currently working on scientific collaboration electronic communication and related topics. Two main results are anticipated: a specific analysis of NCEAS and its influence on collaboration within the field of ecology and a coordinated research and writing effort on larger issues in the changing pattern of scientific collaboration. 	1999	2002134:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	54	16	0.015151515	0.03030303	0.015151515	0	0.227272727	0	0.045454545	0	0.060606061	0.045454545	0	0.075757576	0.090909091	0.060606061	0	0.333333333	0.010416667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.010416667	0.083333333	0	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0	0.010416667	0	0.0625	0	0.010416667	0	0	0.020833333	0	0.010416667	0	0.020833333	0	0.09375	0.010416667	0	0	0	0	0.03125	0	0.197916667	0.020833333	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.166666667	0	0	0	0	0.072916667	0.010416667	0	0	0	0	0	0.020833333	0	0	0	0	0.010416667	0.03125	0.010416667	0	0.010416667	0.010416667	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2226	" ;Arneberg, Per; "	Comparative Studies of Abundance and Species Richness Patterns among Mammalian Nematodes	 My research interests are in the domain of macroecology. I am doing comparative studies of abundance and species richness patterns among mammalian nematodes. Papers have been published so far in The American Naturalist and Proceedings of The Royal Society of London Series B.The questions I ask are about general determinants of abundance and species richness in communities of nematodes in mammals. Thus I aim to focus directly on ecological processes that are common to large number of species and that hence can be used to make general predictions about community dynamics. I am also interested in the implications general ecological processes have for the ways we address evolutionary questions.My work this fall will include analyses of a large number of sets or raw data obtained from parasitologists around the world. Species richness estimates are biased by number of host individuals examined and data on the number of parasites from each individual host is required to obtain estimates that are unbiased by host sample size. In the literature only summary data are normally available and I have therefore written to a number of colleagues either directly or through journals (Arneberg Parasitology Today 1999 15: 208 various society bulletines) asking for access to their raw data. The community has responded positively and I am now in the process of building up the database that may allow me to perform comparative studies of parasite species richness patterns that are not hampered by the otherwise biasing effect of unequal sampling effort. As I see it such cooperation between field and comparative ecologists is a potentially powerful way to synthesize ecological data and may be of general interest to NCEAS. 	1999	1999154:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	4	16	0.125	0	0.03125	0	0	0	0.09375	0.15625	0	0.03125	0.09375	0.03125	0.1875	0	0	0.25	0	0	0	0.177777778	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.066666667	0	0	0	0	0	0.133333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.088888889	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.044444444	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022222222	0	0	0.066666667	0	0.022222222	0	0.022222222	0	0.022222222	0	0	0.044444444	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.022222222	0.044444444	0	0	0	0	0	0.022222222	0.044444444	0	0.022222222	0	0.066666667	0.022222222	0.022222222	0	0	0.022222222	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		2271	" ;Murdoch, William; "	Integrative research in population dynamics 	 I propose to write with two co authors a monograph that will present general theory for the dynamics of parasitoid host interactions.

In particular little is known about the mechanisms of either disease transmission or host resistance and their roles in facilitating disease outbreaks. Although theoretical and experimental practices developed to model infectious disease in humans (Anderson and May 1991) wildlife (Daszak . 2000) and agricultural systems (Real 1996) have provided some useful insight the applicability of these   terrestrial   models to comparatively more open system like the ocean is not known. Moreover knowledge of mechanisms of host resistance among marine invertebrates is effectively a black box; we lack understanding of basic disease resistance mechanisms and their interaction with environmental stressors. Using a few well studied host pathogen interactions or those with long term monitoring data we will 1) synthesize what is currently know about marine diseases and their environmental drivers 2) develop new epidemiological theory for analysis of marine diseases and 3) review differences between disease ecology in marine and terrestrial habitats including the consequences of spill over of infectious micro organisms from farmed into wild populations. 	2000	2002231:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	54	16	0.011904762	0.023809524	0.047619048	0.047619048	0	0	0.107142857	0.083333333	0.023809524	0	0	0	0.154761905	0	0	0.5	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0.012658228	0.025316456	0	0	0	0	0.17721519	0.037974684	0.025316456	0	0.025316456	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0.037974684	0	0	0	0	0	0.025316456	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0	0	0.063291139	0.050632911	0	0.012658228	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0.240506329	0	0.012658228	0.012658228	0.012658228	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.012658228	0	0.012658228	0.025316456	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.075949367	0	0.012658228	0	0	0.012658228	0.012658228	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		3820	" ;Altizer, Sonia; Nunn, Charles; "	Understanding the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases in mammalian mating and social systems	 Variation in animal mating and social behavior has important consequences for the origin and persistence of infectious diseases. These behavioral processes determine local host density and govern the type and frequency of contacts that occur within and among groups of animals. Ecologists have made great progress in understanding infectious disease dynamics operating on ecological time scales yet next to nothing is known about patterns of disease at broad evolutionary scales. Given the increasing availability of information on socio ecological parameters and disease in wild populations along with robust phylogenies the time is right to integrate efforts across these levels of analysis. Thus our interdisciplinary working group will coordinate empirical and theoretical approaches to investigate how host social organization and mating behavior affect the maintenance and spread of infectious diseases in mammals. We will use large datasets and phylogenies in three groups of mammals primates ungulates and carnivores to conduct phylogenetically controlled comparative studies and formulate predictive models of the consequences of variation in socio ecological parameters for disease risk. Simultaneously we will use computer simulations and population modeling techniques to generate predictions that can be examined with the comparative data. By filling the enormous gaps in our knowledge regarding the links between disease and mating and social systems our study will identify key factors responsible for the dynamics and evolution of infectious diseases in animal populations. 	2001	2002295:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	54	16	0.049382716	0.037037037	0.037037037	0	0.024691358	0.061728395	0.024691358	0.074074074	0.024691358	0	0.012345679	0.037037037	0.061728395	0	0.074074074	0.481481481	0.008849558	0.008849558	0	0	0.088495575	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0.008849558	0.061946903	0.017699115	0.132743363	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0.017699115	0	0	0.008849558	0	0.008849558	0.017699115	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017699115	0	0	0	0.053097345	0	0	0.03539823	0.026548673	0.008849558	0.008849558	0	0.221238938	0.017699115	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0.008849558	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0	0	0.053097345	0.008849558	0	0	0.053097345	0.008849558	0	0.008849558	0.008849558	0	0	0	0.008849558	0	0	0.008849558					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6060	" ;Nunn, Charles; Altizer, Sonia; "	Understanding the role of infectious disease in mammalian mating and social systems 	 This meeting will focus on (1) integrating the various datasets that are being compiled by individual members of the group which is necessary for distributing these data over the WWW (2) finalizing statistical results that are being conducted currently by individuals or subgroups of the working group and (3) finishing manuscripts that are co authored by three or more members of the working group. We have made great progress on compiling records of parasites and infectious diseases in over 100 species of wild primates with the first round of results from our analyses nearly finalized. In addition to examining the effects of host social and mating behavior two interesting patterns that have emerged in repeated comparative tests are the importance of host density and host diversification rates in explaining parasite community diversity within species. Members of our working group have begun compiling similar data on carnivores and ungulates while others are building databases of parasite species traits (including host specificity and transmission mode). We have already produced four published (or in press) papers that acknowledge NCEAS support initiated a second effort to collaborate with Conservation International in applying these data to conservation issues and received NSF funds to support components of this project that lie outside the realm of NCEAS funding. At this stage the bulk of our remaining research can be accomplished individually and within subgroups over email. However a final meeting is necessary to integrate these currently independent datasets and spearhead our efforts to disseminate the data and results over the WWW and through journal publications. Merging multiple datasets on hosts and parasites requires the expertise of both veterinary parasitologists and comparative biologists examining the data simultaneously. At the meeting in June 2003 we would also like to work with Mark Schildhauer to develop a format for data presentation over the WWW. Moreover during the past two meetings theoreticians in our group have developed an innovative individual based model for varying social and mating systems to examine the consequences for the spread and evolution of infectious disease. The conceptual framework for this model required three full meetings to develop and was surprisingly advanced by input from nearly everyone in the working group. Because this model will be coded and tested during the next 10 months it will be essential to obtain feedback and criticism from behavioral ecologists and parasite specialists following their initial series of simulations. 	2003	2003316:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0.018867925	0	0.018867925	0	0	0.132075472	0.037735849	0.320754717	0.018867925	0.018867925	0.037735849	0	0	0	0.037735849	0.358490566	0	0	0.034482759	0.086206897	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.25862069	0	0	0	0	0.051724138	0.034482759	0	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.034482759	0.017241379	0.051724138	0.051724138	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.051724138	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0.017241379	0.017241379	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.017241379	0	0	0.034482759	0.051724138	0	0	0	0	0	0.034482759	0	0	0.017241379					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		6881	" ;Dobson, Andrew; Pascual, Mercedes; "	Seasonality and the population dynamics of infectious diseases	 Seasonal variation takes many forms in the natural world. All of us notice the annual cycles in temperature day length and rainfall and these have profound effects on rates of resource production and availability that plants and animals respond to in order to modify their reproduction and maintenance schedules. These regular cycles impose constraints and create opportunities for transmission of infectious diseases. Humans also superimpose seasonal processes onto their lives in a way that creates opportunities for infectious diseases; for example school semesters and annual vacations.

West Nile virus affects bird and mammal populations worldwide and is recognized as an emerging disease of substantial public health veterinary and conservation concern. The virus primarily infects and replicates in birds but also affects unintended hosts such as humans when local bird communities have high levels of infection. Some bird species are much more likely to harbor the virus than others and ecological theory predicts that the structure of local bird communities affects the amount of virus in the area and the chances of humans contracting the disease. In particular as the diversity of local bird populations increases the disease should be diluted among less competent hosts and human disease incidence is predicted to decrease. Therefore in areas with greater avian diversity human incidence of West Nile should be lower. I will test this ecological prediction by comparing incidence of human West Nile infection with measures of avian community structure and diversity across the Eastern and Central US states from 2002 05. My own pilot data support these predictions and suggest that the completed project can be used to better predict the risk of West Nile to humans and can inform the design of more effective public health initiatives. 	2007	2008467:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	37	16	0	0.065217391	0.152173913	0	0	0	0.02173913	0.02173913	0.02173913	0	0.282608696	0.065217391	0	0	0.02173913	0.347826087	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0.06122449	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.285714286	0.020408163	0	0	0	0.040816327	0	0	0	0.020408163	0.020408163	0	0	0.040816327	0	0	0	0.265306122	0.020408163	0	0.040816327	0.020408163	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.020408163	0	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12106	" ;Pascual, Mercedes; Lafferty, Kevin; Dobson, Andrew; "	Parasites and food webs the ultimate missing links	 Food webs are a conceptual underpinning for community ecology.

The groups research will be focused on three overlapping topics. First we will investigate how cognitive skills influence social network self organization and interact with landscape processes such as habit degradation and hunting to determine patterns of disease emergence. Second we will evaluate both generic strategies for controlling disease in protected areas and detailed case studies of optimal disease control in specific systems including a special focus on controlling the impact of Ebola which has killed about one third of the worlds protected area gorilla population over the last 15 years. Third the group will perform cost benefit analyses to evaluate the cost effectiveness and feasibility of vaccination relative to other conservation strategies as well as make recommendations on which steps need to be taken to streamline the movement of vaccines and treatments from laboratory development to field implementation.

This is often the situation for parasitic or locally contaminant infectious diseases or location specific reservoirs that re infect populations. For these types of diseases particularly those that may be the subject of vaccination programs agent based models incorporating explicit landscapes may provide a more appropriate framework for analyzing disease spread. However introducing the complexity of geographically explicit landscape interactions particularly with temporal dynamics is irrelevant if the mechanisms and agency of disease spread within that landscape is not reducible to patterns at a scale meaningful to the models mechanistic drivers. In this project I propose to examine a specific landscape Kibale National Park Uganda in which primate parasitic disease anthropogenic fragmentation and climate change are posited to be interacting. I am currently working on agent based models of zoonotic diseases particularly addressing the human primate interface and would like to complement this work with quantified data driven dynamic landscapes.

Understanding the extent and cause of tropical insect diversity is one of the major challenges in modern ecology (Godfray . 1999) and generally requires two approaches: 1) rigorous biodiversity inventories of the insects at particular sites; and 2) reconstructing food webs demonstrating the trophic interactions between species. Those two approaches are the major goals of this project and include testing specific hypotheses on microgastrine ecology and evolution. Specifically I will integrate the genetic data (CO1 DNA barcodes) with inventory records to assess the number of species of microgastrine wasps and levels of host specificity. This will be followed by construction and analyses of microgastrine parasitoid food webs which will provide insights into community structure crucial in interpreting patterns of parasitoid diversity and provide the basis for hypotheses about structuring processes. 	2010	2013656:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0	0.13559322	0	0	0	0	0.016949153	0.016949153	0.033898305	0	0	0.084745763	0.016949153	0	0.13559322	0.559322034	0	0.053333333	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0.44	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0.013333333	0.013333333	0.013333333	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0.066666667	0.106666667	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.013333333	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0	0	0.04	0	0.04	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.026666667	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12661	" ;Kilpatrick, Auston; Voyles, Jamie; Briggs, Cheryl; "	Fungal pathogens and disease induced extinction: Are fungal diseases different?

Many of these body size dependent processes (such as body temperature metabolic rate fever etc.) are likely to influence the course of infection within an animal. I am interested in how these size dependent processes alter pathogen population growth. Rather than simply examining the factors that influence microbial population growth I aim to consider infection dynamics as a question of pathogen population growth in a potentially hostile environment. This environment includes attacking natural enemies nutrient supply rate and toxic chemicals that influence both pathogen and the host. I hope to explore these ideas broadly but to start with the simple question of fever as a function of body size. Fever is known to vary between children and adults but the comparison confounds age with size. By searching for data on dwarfs and using statistical techniques to factor out age I will assess the extent to which fever scales with body size and in turn how the duration of an infection scales with body size. Other aspects of immune responses such as white blood cell counts and stress hormone titres will be explored as well. Understanding the duration of an infection is not just an issue at the individual level but is a critical parameter defining the threshold host density at which epidemics erupt and the basic reproductive rate for infections. This duration has received scant attention in the literature but may be one of the most labile aspects of disease dynamics. 	1999	2001662:20140529ProjectCategorizations_ValuesOnly	16	16	0.049019608	0.098039216	0.264705882	0.039215686	0.019607843	0.039215686	0	0.019607843	0	0.009803922	0.019607843	0	0.009803922	0.029411765	0.039215686	0.362745098	0.009009009	0.009009009	0.009009009	0	0.036036036	0	0	0	0.036036036	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0.018018018	0.288288288	0	0.009009009	0	0.009009009	0	0.009009009	0.036036036	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018018018	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.018018018	0	0	0	0.036036036	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0.009009009	0.018018018	0.018018018	0	0.009009009	0	0	0.009009009	0	0.108108108	0.135135135	0.054054054	0	0	0.018018018	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0.009009009	0.009009009	0	0	0.009009009	0	0.009009009	0	0	0	0					NaN					NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN	NaN		12667	" ;Bharti, Nita; Dobson, Andrew; Bonds, Matthew; "	Venture: Understanding how land use change impacts the dynamics of vector borne and water borne infectious disease of humans and domestic livestock	 Land use change is rapidly converting forests and savannas into anthro habitat : land whose primary focus is the production of agriculture or other goods and services of direct benefit to the human economy. This conversion significantly alters the interactions between the environment disease vector species and populations of humans and domestic livestock. The resulting changes in the infection dynamics of many vector and water borne disease systems lead to new opportunities for pathogen infections and only occasionally steer the dynamics towards pathogen reduction or eradication. In this venture we undertake a series of synthetic examinations that bring together GIS data on land use change with data on disease and vector distributions and host abundance in order to develop mathematical and heuristic models. The goal is to understand the impact of land use change on disease ecology to minimize disease risk and maximize direct and indirect economic benefits. Our initial focus is on malaria schistosomiasis cholera Chagas disease and African trypanosomiasis. Our approaches will build upon the large sets of data available for these pathogens to develop synthetic model frameworks that can primarily produce locally specific anthropologically appropriate actionable recommendations for minimizing disease risk. This framework will ultimately be adaptable to examine the interactions between land use change and a broad variety of pathogens. 	2013	20131026:NCEASpubsWOSfullRecord_wCitationReportThru20131231_updated20140529	14	1	0.253164557	0.012658228	0	0.075949367	0.012658228	0.012658228	0.088607595	0.012658228	0.037974684	0.088607595	0.012658228	0.012658228	0.075949367	0	0.240506329	0.063291139	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0.036144578	0	0.024096386	0.012048193	0	0	0.240963855	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.012048193	0.036144578	0	0	0	0	0	0.096385542	0.036144578	0	0	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.060240964	0	0	0.024096386	0.024096386	0.012048193	0	0	0.036144578	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.012048193	0.012048193	0.012048193	0	0	0.036144578	0	0	0	0	0	0.024096386	0.024096386	0	0.012048193	0	0.012048193	0	0	0.012048193	0.072289157	0.012048193	0	0	0	0	0.012048193	0.012048193	22003	;7961;	" Drake, JM;
